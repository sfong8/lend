(b) Equity Cure
The Company may cure or prevent a breach of the Financial Covenant in respect of any 
Testing Period (the &quot;Applicable Period&quot;) if, prior to the expiry of the Cure Period, the 
Group has received one or more Cure Amounts and the Company has elected that all or any 
part of any Cure Amounts so received shall, at the option of the Company, be:
(i)included for the Testing Period as if provided immediately prior to such Test Date 
by increasing the amount of Consolidated EBITDA (an &quot;EBITDA Cure&quot;) and if, 
following such inclusion and increase, the Financial Covenant would have been 
complied with for the Testing Period, the relevant failure to comply with the 
Financial Covenant shall be treated as having been cured or prevented;

Covenant shall be treated as having been cured or prevented; or

&quot;Prepayment Cure&quot;) and if, following such prepayment, the Test Condition is no 
longer met, the relevant failure to comply with the Financial Covenant shall be 
treated as having been cured or prevented,

(1) on more than five (5) occasions from the Closing Date in 
aggregate; or
(2) more than twice in any three consecutive Relevant Periods;
(B) there shall be no restriction on any Cure Amount exceeding the amount 
necessary to prevent or cure the relevant failure to comply with the

calculation, permission or usage under or in respect of the Finance 
Documents (including when calculating the applicable Margin);
(F) (except for the Applicable Period in the case of an EBITDA Cure) the 
cash proceeds of any Cure Amount may, to the extent remaining as cash 
on balance sheet and without double-counting, be taken into account as 
cash for the purposes of this Agreement (including for cash netting 
purposes in any Applicable Metric);
(G) in relation to any EBITDA Cure, Net Debt Cure or Prepayment Cure 
effected:
(1) on or prior to the delivery of the relevant Compliance Certificate 
for the Applicable Period, the Compliance Certificate for that 
Applicable Period shall set out the revised Financial Covenant 
for the Applicable Period by giving effect to the adjustments to 
Consolidated EBITDA or Senior Secured Indebtedness (as 
applicable) under this paragraph (b), or in the case of a 
Prepayment Cure shall confirm that the Test Condition is not met 
and confirming that such Cure Amount has been provided 
following the end of the Testing Period; and
(2) following the delivery of the relevant Compliance Certificate for 
the Applicable Period, the Company shall deliver to the Agent a 
revised Compliance Certificate which shall set out the revised 
Financial Covenant for the Applicable Period (or confirm that the 
Test Condition was not met for the Applicable Period),
and, for the avoidance of doubt, any Compliance Certificate delivered in 
connection with a EBITDA Cure, Net Debt Cure and Prepayment Cure may also 
reflect any Cure Amount provided and designated in accordance with paragraph 
(c) below.
(c) Recalculation Cure
The Company may cure or prevent a breach of the Financial Covenant in respect of any 
Applicable Period at any time by electing to recalculate:
(i)the Test Condition for the Applicable Period or any subsequent date 
(notwithstanding that such date is not a Test Date) for which the Company has 
sufficient available information to effect such recalculation; or
(ii)the Financial Covenant for the Applicable Period or any subsequent Relevant 
Period (notwithstanding that such Relevant Period is not a Testing Period) for 
which the Company has sufficient available information to effect such 
recalculation,
(a &quot;Recalculation&quot;) and if, taking into account such Recalculation:
(A) the Test Condition would not be met as at the last day of the Applicable 
Period or on any subsequent date; or
(B) the Financial Covenant would be complied with for the Applicable Period 
or if calculated for any subsequent Relevant Period (notwithstanding that 
such Relevant Period is not a Testing Period),</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 219 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreementthe relevant failure to comply with the Financial Covenant shall be treated as 
having been cured or prevented, provided that, in relation to any Recalculation 
effected:

for the Applicable Period, the Compliance Certificate for that 
Applicable Period shall set out the revised Financial Covenant 
for the Applicable Period following such Recalculation (or shall 
confirm that the Test Condition is not met following such 
Recalculation); and
(2) following the delivery of the relevant Compliance Certificate for 
the Applicable Period, the Company shall deliver to the Agent a 
revised Compliance Certificate which shall set out the revised 
Financial Covenant for the Applicable Period following such 
Recalculation (or shall confirm that the Test Condition was not 
met for the Applicable Period following such Recalculation),
and, for the avoidance of doubt, any Compliance Certificate delivered in 
connection with a Recalculation may also reflect any Cure Amount provided and 
designated in accordance with paragraph (b) above.
Any Recalculation pursuant to this paragraph (c) may, at the Company's option, give pro 
forma effect to all Applicable Transactions (and any permitted adjustments to any 
Applicable Metric in connection therewith) for which the Applicable Transaction Date has 
occurred following the end of the Applicable Period or any subsequent Relevant Period as 
if such Applicable Transaction had been consummated on the first day of such Applicable 
Period or Relevant Period (as applicable).
(d) Deemed Cure
If the Financial Covenant has been breached, but:
(i)is complied with when tested on any subsequent Test Date; or
(ii)the Test Condition is not satisfied on any subsequent date (whether or not such 
date is a Test Date),
then, any prior breach of the Financial Covenant or any Default or Event of Default arising 
therefrom shall not (and shall not be deemed to) directly or indirectly constitute, or result 
in, a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the Finance 
Documents or a Default or an Event of Default, unless a Declared RCF Default has arisen 
and is continuing before delivery of the Compliance Certificate in respect of the Relevant 
Period ending on the subsequent Test Date or the subsequent date on which the Test 
Condition is not satisfied.

reference to the facts and circumstances then existing.
(b) No Event of Default will occur under paragraph (a) above if the circumstances giving rise
