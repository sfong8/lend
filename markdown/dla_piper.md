and instructions (including, in the case of a Borrower, Utilisation Requests
and Additional Facility Notices), to execute on its behalf any Accession
Deed, to make such agreements and to effect the relevant amendments,
supplements and variations capable of being given, made or effected by any
Obligor notwithstanding that they may affect the Obligor, without further
reference to or the consent of that Obligor; and

(ii) each Finance Party to give any notice, demand or other communication to
that Obligor pursuant to the Finance Documents to the Parent,


-----

and in each case the Obligor shall be bound as though the Obligor itself had given the
notices and instructions (including, without limitation, any Utilisation Requests) or
executed or made the agreements or effected the amendments, supplements or
variations, or received the relevant notice, demand or other communication.

(b) Every act, omission, agreement, undertaking, settlement, waiver, amendment,
supplement, variation, notice or other communication given or made by the Obligors'
Agent or given to the Obligors' Agent under any Finance Document on behalf of
another Obligor or in connection with any Finance Document (whether or not known
to any other Obligor and whether occurring before or after such other Obligor became
an Obligor under any Finance Document) shall be binding for all purposes on that
Obligor as if that Obligor had expressly made, given or concurred with it. In the
event of any conflict between any notices or other communications of the Obligors'
Agent and any other Obligor, those of the Obligors' Agent shall prevail.

Ancillary Outstandings are repaid not later than the Termination Date
applicable to the Revolving Facility (or such earlier date as the Revolving

reduced to zero).


-----

(c) If there is any inconsistency between any term of an Ancillary Facility and any term

be due on demand), each Lender and each Ancillary Lender shall (subject to
clause 7.6(g)) promptly adjust (by making or receiving (as the case may be)
corresponding transfers of rights and obligations under the Finance Documents
relating to Revolving Outstandings) their claims in respect of amounts outstanding to
them under the Revolving Facility and each Ancillary Facility to the extent necessary
to ensure that after such transfers the Revolving Outstandings of each Lender bear the
same proportion to the Total Revolving Outstandings as such Lender's Revolving
Facility Commitment bears to the Total Revolving Facility Commitments, each as at

(c) If an amount outstanding under an Ancillary Facility is a contingent liability and that
contingent liability becomes an actual liability or is reduced to zero after the original
adjustment is made under clause 7.6(b), then each Lender and Ancillary Lender will
make a further adjustment (by making or receiving (as the case may be)
corresponding transfers of rights and obligations under the Finance Documents
relating to Revolving Outstandings to the extent necessary) to put themselves in the


-----

position they would have been in had the original adjustment been determined by
reference to the actual liability or, as the case may be, zero liability and not the
contingent liability.

(d) Any transfer of rights and obligations relating to Revolving Outstandings made
pursuant to this clause 7.6 shall be made for a purchase price in cash, payable at the
time of transfer, in an amount equal to those Revolving Outstandings (less any
accrued interest, fees and commission to which the transferor will remain entitled to
receive notwithstanding that transfer, pursuant to clause 27.11 (Pro rata interest
_settlement))._

has provided a Multi-account Overdraft shall set-off any Available Credit Balance on

Parties.

**7.8** **Affiliates of Lenders as Ancillary Lenders**

Ancillary Lender. In such case, the Lender and its Affiliate shall be treated as a
single Lender whose Revolving Facility Commitment is the amount set out opposite
the relevant Lender's name in part 2 of schedule 1 _The Original Parties) and/or the_
amount of any Revolving Facility Commitment transferred to or assumed by that
Lender under this Agreement, to the extent (in each case) not cancelled, reduced or
transferred by it under this Agreement.

(b) The Parent shall specify any relevant Affiliate of a Lender in any notice delivered by
the Parent to the Agent pursuant to clause 7.2(b)(i).

(c) An Affiliate of a Lender which becomes an Ancillary Lender shall accede to the

the Intercreditor Agreement shall, at the same time, become a Party as an Ancillary
Lender in accordance with clause 20.9 (Creditor Accession Undertaking) of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

(d) If a Lender assigns all of its rights and benefits or transfers all of its rights and
obligations to a New Lender, its Affiliate shall cease to have any obligations under
this Agreement or any Ancillary Document.


-----

is not a party to that document, the relevant Lender shall ensure that the obligation is
performed by its Affiliate.

Wales of a Borrower may with the approval of the relevant Lender become a

under this Agreement or any Ancillary Document.

Borrower under an Ancillary Facility and the relevant Borrower is an Affiliate of a
Borrower which is not a party to that document, the relevant Borrower shall ensure
that the obligation is performed by its Affiliate.

(e) Any reference to this Agreement or any other Finance Document to a Borrower being
under no obligations (whether actual or contingent) as a Borrower under such Finance
Document shall be construed to include a reference to any Affiliate of a Borrower
being under no obligations under any Finance Document or Ancillary Document.

**7.10** **Revolving Facility Commitment amounts**

Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement, each Lender shall ensure that at all times
its Revolving Facility Commitment is not less than:

(a) its Ancillary Commitment; or

(b) the Ancillary Commitment of its Affiliate.

**7.11** **Amendments and Waivers - Ancillary Facilities**

No amendment or waiver of a term of any Ancillary Facility shall require the consent of any
Finance Party other than the relevant Ancillary Lender unless such amendment or waiver
itself relates to or gives rise to a matter which would require an amendment of or under this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, under this clause 7). In such a case,
clause 39 (Amendments and waivers) will apply.

Borrower:

(A) on the same day that a maturing Revolving Facility Loan is due to be
repaid by that Borrower;

(B) in the same currency as the maturing Revolving Facility Loan; and

(C) in whole or in part for the purpose of refinancing the maturing
Revolving Facility Loan; and

(ii) the proportion borne by each Lender's participation in the maturing
Revolving Facility Loan to the amount of that maturing Revolving Facility
Loan is the same as the proportion borne by that Lender's participation in the
new Revolving Facility Loans to the aggregate amount of those new
Revolving Facility Loans,

the aggregate amount of the new Revolving Facility Loans shall, unless the relevant
Borrower or the Parent notifies the Agent to the contrary in the relevant Utilisation
Request, be treated as if applied in or towards repayment of the maturing Revolving
Facility Loan so that:


-----

(A) if the amount of the maturing Revolving Facility Loan exceeds the

clause 33.1 (Payments to the Agent) in respect of its
participation in the new Revolving Facility Loans only to the
extent that its participation in the new Revolving Facility

Revolving Facility Loan and the remainder of that Lender's
participation in the new Revolving Facility Loans shall be
treated as having been made available and applied by the
Borrower in or towards repayment of that Lender's
participation in the maturing Revolving Facility Loan.

(d) At any time when a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, the maturity date of each of
the participations of that Lender in the Revolving Facility Loans then outstanding will

Facility and will be treated as separate Revolving Facility Loans (the **"Separate**
**Loans") denominated in the currency in which the relevant participations are**
outstanding.

notice, cancel the whole or any part (being an amount that reduces the Base Currency
Amount of the relevant Available Facility by a minimum amount of £100,000). Any
cancellation under this clause 9.2 shall reduce the Commitments of the Lenders
rateably under that Facility.

(b) Any notice of cancellation of the Available Commitments with respect to the
Revolving Facility delivered at any time while Loans under any other Facility remain

instructions of the Majority Lender) and the Parent may agree from time to time.

(b) A Term Loan may only be prepaid after the last day of the Availability Period for the
applicable Facility (or, if earlier, the day on which the applicable Available Facility is
zero).

(c) Subject to clause 9.3(b), a Term Loan shall only be prepaid if the Term Loans are:

(ii) prepaid in amounts which reduce the Facility B Loan and the Additional
Facility Loans by the same proportion.

**9.4** **Voluntary prepayment of Revolving Facility Loans**

A Borrower to which a Revolving Facility Loan has been made may, if it or the Parent gives
the Agent not less than five Business Days' (or such shorter period as the Majority Super

Loan (but if in part, being an amount that reduces the Base Currency Amount of the
Revolving Facility Loan by a minimum amount of £100,000 (and in integral amounts of
£100,000)).

**9.5** **Right of cancellation and repayment in relation to a single Lender**

(a) If:

under clause 16.2(c); or

(ii) any Lender claims indemnification from the Parent or an Obligor under
clause 16.3 (Tax indemnity) or clause 17.1 (Increased costs),

increase or indemnification continues, give the Agent notice (if such circumstances
relate to a Lender) of cancellation of the Commitment(s) of that Lender and its
intention to procure the repayment of that Lender's participation in the Loans.

(b) On receipt of a notice referred to in clause 9.5(a) in relation to a Lender, the
Commitments of that Lender shall immediately be reduced to zero in the case of a
notice of cancellation and repayment or transferred to another entity pursuant to
clause 39.8 (Replacement of Lender).

(c) On the last day of each Interest Period which ends after the Parent has given notice
under clause 9.5(a) in relation to a Lender (or, if earlier, the date specified by the
Parent in that notice), in the case of a notice of repayment or cancellation, each
Borrower to which a Loan is outstanding shall repay that Lender's participation in that
Loan together with all interest and other amounts accrued under the Finance

**14.** **CHANGES TO THE CALCULATION OF INTEREST**

**14.1** **Unavailability of Screen Rate**

(a) _Interpolated Screen Rate: If no Screen Rate is available for LIBOR or, if applicable,_
EURIBOR or, if applicable, WIBOR, for the Interest Period of a Loan, the applicable
LIBOR or EURIBOR or WIBOR, shall be the Interpolated Screen Rate for a period
equal in length to the Interest Period of that Loan.

(b) _Base_ _Reference Bank Rate: If no Screen Rate is available for LIBOR or, if applicable,_
EURIBOR or, if applicable, WIBOR, for:

(i) the currency of a Loan; or

(ii) the Interest Period of a Loan and it is not possible to calculate the
Interpolated Screen Rate,

the applicable LIBOR or EURIBOR or WIBOR shall be the Base Reference Bank
Rate as of the Specified Time for the currency of that Loan and for a period equal in
length to the Interest Period of that Loan.

(c) _Cost of funds: If 14.1(b) applies but no Base Reference Bank Rate is available for the_

Interest Period.

**14.2** **Calculation of Base Reference Bank Rate**

(a) Subject to clause 14.2(b), if LIBOR or EURIBOR or WIBOR is to be determined on

EURIBOR, or, if applicable, WIBOR, then clause 14.4 (Cost of funds) shall apply to that
Loan for the relevant Interest Period.

**14.4** **Cost of funds**

(a) If this clause 14.4 applies, the rate of interest on each Lender's share of the relevant

event within five Business Days of the first day of that Interest Period (or, if
earlier, on the date falling five Business Days before the date on which
interest is due to be paid in respect of that Interest Period), to be that which
expresses as a percentage rate per annum the cost to the relevant Lender of
funding its participation in that Loan from whatever source it may reasonably
select.

(b) If this clause 14.4 applies and the Agent or the Parent so requires, the Agent and the
Parent shall enter into negotiations (for a period of not more than 30 days) with a
view to agreeing a substitute basis for determining the rate of interest.

(i) a Lender's Funding Rate is less than LIBOR or, in relation to any Loan in
euro, EURIBOR or, in relation to any Loan in Zloty, WIBOR; or

(ii) a Lender does not supply a quotation by the time specified in
clause 14.4(a)(ii),

the cost to that Lender of funding its participation in that Loan for that Interest Period
shall be deemed, for the purposes of clause 14.4(a), to be LIBOR or, in relation to any
Loan in euro, EURIBOR or, in relation to any Loan in Zloty, WIBOR.

(e) If this clause 14.4 applies pursuant to clause 14.3 (Market disruption) but any Lender
does not supply a quotation by the time specified in clause 14.4(a)(ii) the rate of
interest shall be calculated on the basis of the quotations of the remaining Lenders.

pursuant to clause 9.1 (Illegality), clause 10.2 (Acquisition, Disposal and Insurance
_Proceeds) or clause 24.5(b)), that Borrower must pay to the Agent (for the account of_
the Lenders), together with such Relevant Non-Call Prepayment, a prepayment fee in
an amount equal to the amount of all payments of interest (calculated in accordance
with clause 12 (Interest)), fees, commissions and other amounts that, but for the
Relevant Non-Call Prepayment, would have accrued or become payable, in respect of
the amount of the Relevant Non-Call Prepayment, during the period from and
including the date on which the Relevant Non-Call Prepayment is made until (and
including) the second anniversary of the Closing Date (the **"Makewhole Period"),**

by that Finance Party; or

(ii) to the extent a loss, liability or cost:

(A) is compensated for by an increased payment under clause 16.2 (Tax
_gross-up);_

(B) would have been compensated for by an increased payment under
clause 16.2 (Tax gross-up) but was not so compensated solely
because one of the exclusions in clause 16.2(d) applied; or

following which the Agent shall notify the Parent.

(b) a Qualifying Lender (other than a Treaty Lender); or

(c) a Treaty Lender.

If such a Lender fails to indicate its status in accordance with this clause 16.5 then that Lender
shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement (including by each Obligor) as if it is not a
Qualifying Lender until such time as it notifies the Agent which category applies (and the
Agent, upon receipt of such notification, shall inform the Parent). For the avoidance of doubt,
the documentation which a Lender executes on becoming a Party shall not be invalidated by
any failure of a Lender to comply with this clause 16.5.

Secured Party against any cost, loss or liability that Secured Party incurs in relation to all

(a) All amounts expressed to be payable under a Finance Document by any Party to a
Finance Party which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for any supply
for VAT purposes are deemed to be exclusive of any VAT which is chargeable on
that supply, and accordingly, subject to clause 16.7(b), if VAT is or becomes
chargeable on any supply made by any Finance Party to any Party under a Finance
Document and such Finance Party is required to account to the relevant tax authority


-----

for the VAT, that Party must pay to such Finance Party (in addition to and at the same
time as paying any other consideration for such supply) an amount equal to the
amount of the VAT (and such Finance Party must promptly provide an appropriate
VAT invoice to that Party).

(b) If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Finance Party (the
**"Supplier") to any other Finance Party (the** **"Recipient") under a Finance**
Document, and any Party other than the Recipient (the "Relevant Party") is required
by the terms of any Finance Document to pay an amount equal to the consideration
for that supply to the Supplier (rather than being required to reimburse or indemnify
the Recipient in respect of that consideration):

(i) (where the Supplier is the person required to account to the relevant tax
authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must also pay to the Supplier (at
the same time as paying that amount) an additional amount equal to the
amount of the VAT. The Recipient must (where this clause 16.7(b)(i)
applies) promptly pay to the Relevant Party an amount equal to any credit or
repayment the Recipient receives from the relevant tax authority which the
Recipient reasonably determines relates to the VAT chargeable on that
supply; and

(ii) (where the Recipient is the person required to account to the relevant tax
authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must promptly, following written
demand from the Recipient, pay to the Recipient an amount equal to the VAT
chargeable on that supply but only to the extent that the Recipient reasonably
determines that it is not entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant tax
authority in respect of that VAT.

(c) Where a Finance Document requires any Party to reimburse or indemnify a Finance
Party for any cost or expense, that Party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case
may be) such Finance Party for the full amount of such cost or expense, including
such part thereof as represents VAT, save to the extent that such Finance Party
reasonably determines that it is entitled to credit or repayment in respect of such VAT
from the relevant tax authority.

(d) Any reference in this clause 16.7 to any Party shall, at any time when such Party is
treated as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and
unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to the representative member of
such group at such time (the term "representative member" to have the same meaning
as in the Value Added Tax Act 1994).

(e) In relation to any supply made by a Finance Party to any Party under a Finance
Document, if reasonably requested by such Finance Party, that Party must promptly
provide such Finance Party with details of that Party's VAT registration and such
other information as is reasonably requested in connection with such Finance Party's
VAT reporting requirements in relation to such supply.


-----

**16.8** **FATCA Information**

(a) Subject to clause 16.8(c), each Party shall, within 10 Business Days of a reasonable
request by another Party:

(i) confirm to that other Party whether it is:

(A) a FATCA Exempt Party; or

(B) not a FATCA Exempt Party;

(ii) supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other information
relating to its status under FATCA as that other Party reasonably requests for
the purposes of that other Party's compliance with FATCA; and

(iii) supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other information
relating to its status as that other Party reasonably requests for the purposes of
that other Party's compliance with any other law, regulation, or exchange of
information regime.

(b) If a Party confirms to another Party pursuant to clause 16.8(a)(i) that it is a FATCA
Exempt Party and it subsequently becomes aware that it is not, or has ceased to be a
FATCA Exempt Party, that Party shall notify that other Party reasonably promptly.

(c) Clause 16.8(a) shall not oblige any Finance Party to do anything and
clause 16.8(a)(iii) shall not oblige any other Party to do anything, which would or
might in its reasonable opinion constitute a breach of:

(i) any law or regulation;

(ii) any fiduciary duty; or

(iii) any duty of confidentiality.

(d) If a Party fails to confirm whether or not it is a FATCA Exempt Party or to supply
forms, documentation or other information requested in accordance with
clause 16.8(a)(i) or 16.8(a)(ii) (including, for the avoidance of doubt, where
clause 16.8(c) applies), then such Party shall be treated for the purposes of the
Finance Documents (and payments under them) as if it is not a FATCA Exempt Party
until such time as the Party in question provides the requested confirmation, forms,
documentation or other information.

(e) If a Borrower is a US Tax Obligor or the Agent reasonably believes that its
obligations under FATCA or any other applicable law or regulation require it, each
Lender shall, within 10 Business Days of:

(i) where a Borrower is a US Tax Obligor on a date on which any other Lender

that Obligor's obligations under the Finance Documents;

amount when due under or in connection with any Finance Document, that Guarantor
shall immediately on written demand pay that amount as if it was the principal
obligor; and

unenforceable, invalid or illegal, it will, as an independent and primary obligation,
indemnify that Finance Party immediately on written demand against any cost, loss or
liability it incurs as a result of an Obligor not paying any amount which would, but
for such unenforceability, invalidity or illegality, have been payable by it under any
Finance Document on the date when it would have been due. The amount payable by
a Guarantor under this indemnity will not exceed the amount it would have had to pay
under this clause 21 if the amount claimed had been recoverable on the basis of a
guarantee.

**21.2** **Continuing guarantee**

This guarantee is a continuing guarantee and will extend to the ultimate balance of sums
payable by any Obligor under the Finance Documents, regardless of any intermediate
payment or discharge in whole or in part.

or any security for those obligations or otherwise) is made by a Finance Party in whole or in
part on the basis of any payment, security or other disposition which is avoided or must be
restored in insolvency, liquidation, administration or otherwise, without limitation, then the
liability of each Guarantor under this clause 21 will continue or be reinstated as if the
discharge, release or arrangement had not occurred.


-----

**21.4** **Waiver of defences**

The obligations of each Guarantor under this clause 21 will not be affected by an act,
omission, matter or thing which, but for this clause 21, would reduce, release or prejudice any
of its obligations under this clause 21 (without limitation and whether or not known to it or
any Finance Party) including:

(a) any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any Obligor or other
person;

(b) the release of any other Obligor or any other person under the terms of any
composition or arrangement with any creditor of any member of the Group;

(c) the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or release of, or refusal or
neglect to perfect, take up or enforce, any rights against, or security over assets of,
any Obligor or other person or any non-presentation or non-observance of any
formality or other requirement in respect of any instrument or any failure to realise
the full value of any security;

(d) any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of or dissolution or
change in the members or status of an Obligor or any other person;

(e) any amendment, novation, supplement, extension, restatement (however fundamental
and whether or not more onerous) or replacement of a Finance Document or any other
document or security including, without limitation, any change in the purpose of, any
extension of or increase in any facility or the addition of any new facility under any
Finance Document or other document or security;

(f) any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity of any obligation of any person under any
Finance Document or any other document or security; or

(g) any insolvency or similar proceedings.

or any other agreement or document for the purposes of or in connection with any of the
following: business acquisitions of any nature; increasing working capital; enabling investor
distributions to be made; carrying out restructurings; refinancing existing facilities;
refinancing any other indebtedness; making facilities available to new borrowers; any other
variation or extension of the purposes for which any such facility or amount might be made
available from time to time; and any fees, costs and/or expenses associated with any of the
foregoing.

**21.6** **Immediate recourse**

Each Guarantor waives any right it may have of first requiring any Finance Party (or any
trustee or agent on its behalf) to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or
claim payment from any person before claiming from that Guarantor under this clause 21.
This waiver applies irrespective of any law or any provision of a Finance Document to the
contrary.


-----

**21.7** **Appropriations**

Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection
with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full, each Finance Party (or any
trustee or agent on its behalf) may:

(a) refrain from applying or enforcing any other monies, security or rights held or
received by that Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect of
those amounts, or apply and enforce the same in such manner and order as it sees fit
(whether against those amounts or otherwise) and no Guarantor shall be entitled to
the benefit of the same; and

(b) hold in an interest-bearing suspense account any monies received from any Guarantor
or on account of any Guarantor's liability under this clause 21.

**21.8** **Deferral of Guarantors' rights**

with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full and unless the Agent
otherwise directs, no Guarantor will exercise any rights which it may have by reason of
performance by it of its obligations under any agreement or document or security (including
but not limited to the Finance Documents or by reason of any amount being payable, or
liability arising, under this clause 21:

(b) to claim any contribution from any other guarantor of any Obligor's obligations under
the Finance Documents;

other agreement or of any other guarantee or security taken pursuant to, or in
connection with, the Finance Documents by any Finance Party;

(d) to bring legal or other proceedings for an order requiring any Obligor to make any
payment, or perform any obligation, in respect of which any Guarantor has given a
guarantee, undertaking or indemnity under clause 21.1 (Guarantee and indemnity);

(e) to exercise any right of set-off against any Obligor; and/or

(f) to claim or prove as a creditor of any Obligor in competition with any Finance Party.

If a Guarantor receives any benefit, payment or distribution in relation to such rights it shall
hold that benefit, payment or distribution to the extent necessary to enable all amounts which
may be or become payable to the Finance Parties by the Obligors under or in connection with
the Finance Documents to be repaid in full on trust or on behalf of (as applicable) for the
Finance Parties and shall promptly pay or transfer the same to the Agent or as the Agent may
direct for application in accordance with clause 33 (Payment mechanics).


-----

**21.9** **Release of Guarantors' right of contribution**

If any Guarantor (a "Retiring Guarantor") ceases to be a Guarantor in accordance with the
terms of the Finance Documents for the purpose of any sale or other disposal of that Retiring
Guarantor then on the date such Retiring Guarantor ceases to be a Guarantor:

(a) that Retiring Guarantor is released by each other Guarantor from any liability
(whether past, present or future and whether actual or contingent) to make a
contribution to any other Guarantor arising by reason of the performance by any other
Guarantor of its obligations under the Finance Documents; and

(b) each other Guarantor waives any rights it may have by reason of the performance of
its obligations under the Finance Documents to take the benefit (in whole or in part
and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Finance Parties
under any Finance Document or of any other security taken pursuant to, or in
connection with, any Finance Document where such rights or security are granted by
or in relation to the assets of the Retiring Guarantor.

security now or subsequently held by any Finance Party.

that it would result in this guarantee constituting unlawful financial assistance within the
meaning of Article 2:98c of the Dutch CC or any other relevant financial assistance
legislation.

**21.12** **Guarantee limitations - England and Wales**

This guarantee does not apply to any liability to the extent that it would result in this
guarantee constituting unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of sections 678 or
679 of the Companies Act 2006 or any equivalent and applicable provisions under the laws of
the Original Jurisdiction of the relevant Guarantor and, with respect to any Additional
Guarantor, is subject to any limitations set out in the Accession Deed applicable to such
Additional Guarantor.

**21.13** **Guarantee limitation - Poland**

The obligations and liabilities under this clause 21 of any Guarantor incorporated in Poland

cover in full its share capital pursuant to Article 189 §2 of the Polish Commercial Companies
Code (Polish: kodeks spółek handlowych) of 15 September 2000, as amended.

**21.14** **Guarantee limitations - United States**

by this clause 21 shall specifically exclude any and all Excluded Swap Obligations.
The foregoing limitation of "obligations" shall be deemed applicable only to the
obligations of any Guarantor under the particular Swap (or Swaps), or, if arising


-----

under a master agreement governing more than one Swap, the portion thereof that
constitute Excluded Swap Obligations.

(b) For the purpose of this clause 21:

**"Excluded Swap Obligations" means, with respect to each Guarantor, any Swap**
Obligation if, and to the extent that, all or a portion of any guarantee of such
Guarantor of, or the grant by such Guarantor of a security interest to secure, such
Swap Obligation (or any guarantee thereof) is or becomes illegal under the U.S.
Commodity Exchange Act or any rule, regulation or order of the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (or the application or official interpretation of any
thereof) by virtue of such Guarantor’s failure for any reason to constitute an “eligible
contract participant” as defined in the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, and
the rules and regulations thereunder at the time the guarantee of such Guarantor or the
grant of a security interest becomes effective with respect to such Swap Obligation.
If a Swap Obligation arises under a master agreement governing more than one swap,
such exclusion shall apply only to the portion of such Swap Obligation that is
attributable to swaps for which such Swap Obligation or collateral pledge is or
becomes illegal;

**"Qualified ECP Guarantor" means, in respect of any Swap Obligation, each**
Obligor that has total assets exceeding $10,000,000 at the time the relevant guarantee
or grant of the relevant security interest becomes effective with respect to such Swap

qualify as an "eligible contract participant" at such time by entering into a keepwell
under Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the CEA;

(c) In any action or proceeding involving any state law of the United States applicable to
any Guarantor because of the form of such Guarantor’s organization, such as
corporate law, limited liability company law, partnership law or trust law, or any US
Debtor Relief Law generally, if the obligations of such Guarantor under this clause 21
would otherwise be held or determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable, or
subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount of such
Guarantor's liability under this clause 21, then, notwithstanding any other provision
hereof to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by
such Guarantor, the Obligors, the Finance Parties or any other person, be
automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable
and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors in such action or proceeding.

**21.15** **Keepwell**

Each Qualified ECP Guarantor (as defined above) hereby jointly and severally, absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds and other support as may be
needed from time to time by each other Obligor to honour all of its obligations under this
Agreement and the other Finance Documents in respect of Swap Obligations (provided,
however, that each Qualified ECP Guarantor shall only be liable under this clause 21.15 for
the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its


-----

obligations under this clause 21.15, or otherwise under this Agreement or any other Finance
Document, voidable under any US Debtor Relief Laws and not for any greater amount). Each
Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this clause 21.15 constitute, and this clause 21.15 shall
be deemed to constitute, a "keepwell, support or other agreement" for the benefit of each
other Obligor for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the CEA. Subject to clause 21.3,

but the Parent does comply with its obligations under clause 24.2 (Financial
_condition) when next tested (the "Second Test Date") then, provided that the Agent_
has not exercised any of its rights under clause 26.19 (Acceleration) in respect of that
Remediable Default prior to delivery of the Compliance Certificate in respect of the
Second Test Date, that Remediable Default shall be automatically remedied from the
date of such Compliance Certificate and any Event of Default arising in respect of or
in connection with the Remediable Default shall no longer be outstanding and/or
continuing for the purposes of the Finance Documents.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the occurrence of a Remediable Default shall constitute
the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing unless and until an

Remediable Default is waived by the Agent.

**Default") for any Relevant Period (the** **"First Relevant Period"), no Event of**
Default will occur if:

_of Compliance Certificate) which demonstrates the Curable Event of Default_
and (B) the date on which relevant financial statements and/or a Compliance
Certificate are due to be delivered under clause 23.1 (Financial statements)
and/or clause 23.2 (Provision and contents of Compliance Certificate) (the
**"Delivery Date"), the Parent has received from the Investors an irrevocable**
undertaking to provide to the Parent the net cash proceeds by way of New
Shareholder Injections necessary to remedy the Curable Event of Default (the
net amount of that New Shareholder Injection necessary to remedy the
Curable Event of Default being the "Cure Amount"); and

(ii) within 20 Business Days after the Delivery Date, the Parent has received
from the Investors the Cure Amount and the Cure Amount has been applied
in accordance with clause 24.5(b).

(b) 50 per cent. of the Cure Amount shall promptly on receipt by the Parent be applied in
prepayment of the Loans in accordance with clause 10.3 (Application of mandatory
_prepayments and cancellations)._

(c) Once the Cure Amount has been applied in accordance with clause 24.5(b), the
financial covenant in clause 24.2(a) (Adjusted Leverage) shall be retested. Such
retesting shall be made on the basis that the Cure Amount has been received and used
to prepay the Loans (in the order set out in clause 10.3 (Application of mandatory
_prepayments and cancellations) on the last day of the First Relevant Period, but in_
each case without double-counting any actual and deemed prepayments of the Loan
and without the Cure Amount being applied more than once or in a manner resulting
in any double-counting.

(d) If after re-testing the financial covenants in accordance with clause 24.5(b), the
financial covenant in clause 24.2(a) (Adjusted Leverage) is complied with, the Parent
shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of that financial covenant as for
the relevant testing dates with the same effect as if there had been no breach of any of
those financial covenants and, if applicable, that Curable Event of Default shall be
deemed remedied for all purposes under the Finance Documents.

(e) The Parent may only remedy a Curable Event of Default:

(i) with New Shareholder Injections;

(ii) up to four times during the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Termination Date for Facility B;

(iii) not in respect of consecutive Financial Quarters; and

(iv) not more than twice in any Financial Year.

(f) There is no limit on the amount of any one Cure Amount.

(g) If:

(i) the Investors notify the Agent or the Parent (whereupon the Parent shall
promptly notify the Agent) that they are not going to provide any New
Shareholder Injections to remedy the Curable Event of Default; or


-----

(ii) no Cure Amount is received by the end of the period stipulated in
clause 24.5(a),

the Agent will be permitted to take any action available to it under clause 26.19
(Acceleration) immediately (or at any time thereafter).

(h) For the avoidance of doubt, this clause 24.5 shall not fetter the ability of the Agent to
take action under clause 26.19 (Acceleration) or under clause 26.20 (Super Senior
_Acceleration) in respect of any other Event of Default or Material Event of Default_
(as applicable) which in each case is not a Curable Event of Default being remedied
in accordance with this clause 24.5.

(i) Any recalculation made under this clause 24.5 will be solely for the purpose of curing
a breach of clause 24.2 (Financial condition) and not for any other purpose including,
without limitation, the calculation of applicable Margin, determining compliance with
Adjusted Leverage ratios in relation to Permitted Acquisitions or determining
compliance with Adjusted Leverage ratios in relation to Permitted Payments.

(j) For the avoidance of doubt, any Cure Amount not applied in prepayment of the Loans
shall not be used at any time by the Parent to fund any Permitted Payment or any
other distribution or payment to its direct or indirect shareholders or their Affiliates or
the Investors.

(i) at a time when to do so would cause the receiving Obligor or that Subsidiary
(despite that person using all reasonable efforts to avoid the relevant Tax
liability) to incur a materially greater Tax liability in respect of the Cash
Balance than it would otherwise incur if the loan were made at a later date;

(ii) if (despite using all reasonable efforts to avoid the breach or result) to do so

-----

receiving Obligor or that Subsidiary or any of such person's directors or

assets and the consolidated turnover of the Group respectively.

(b) Without prejudice to the continuing obligations to meet the requirements of
clause 25.38(a) in relation to itself and all other Subsidiaries, the Parent need only
perform its obligations under clause 25.38(a) in relation to any particular Subsidiary
if it is not unlawful for the relevant person to become a Guarantor and that person
becoming a Guarantor would not result in personal liability for that person's directors
or other management. Each Obligor must use, and must procure that the relevant
person uses, all reasonable endeavours lawfully available to avoid any such
unlawfulness or personal liability. This includes agreeing to a limit on the amount
guaranteed. The Agent may (but shall not be obliged to) agree to such a limit if, in its
opinion, to do so would avoid the relevant unlawfulness or personal liability. Further,
this clause 25.38(b) shall not restrict the obligations of the Parent under

Subject to this clause 27 and to clause 28 (Restriction on Debt Purchase Transactions), a
Lender (the "Existing Lender") may:

(a) enter into sub-participation, sub-contract or similar arrangements pursuant to the
terms of which voting rights of a Lender are (or are capable of being) transferred
(each a "Participation with Voting Rights");

(b) assign any of its rights; or

under any Finance Document to another bank or financial institution or to a trust, fund or
other entity which is regularly engaged in or established for the purpose of making,

**27.2** **Parent consent**

(a) The consent of the Parent is required before any Existing Lender enters into a
Participation with Voting Rights or an assignment or transfer in accordance with
clause 27.1 (Participations, assignments and transfers by the Lenders), unless the
Participation with Voting Rights, the assignment or transfer is:

(i) to an entity identified on the Pre-Approved New Lender List (or to the extent
any name on the Pre-Approved New Lender List does not refer to a specific
legal entity but to a generic general description of any group entity, any entity
that is a member of that group) or to an Affiliate or Related Fund (as
applicable) of any such entity;

(ii) to another Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender;

(iii) if the Existing Lender is a fund, to a fund which is a Related Fund of the
Existing Lender; or

(iv) made at a time when an Event of Default or a Material Event of Default is
continuing.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, no consent is required for any sub-participation, subcontract or similar arrangements in respect of a Lender's obligations under this
Agreement provided that the Lender's voting rights are not (and are not capable of
being) transferred pursuant to the terms thereof.

(c) Notwithstanding clause 27.2(a), an Existing Lender must:

(i) obtain the prior written consent of the Parent (which may be given or refused
in its absolute discretion) before entering into any Participation with Voting
Rights, assignment or transfer to, with, involving or in favour of a person that


-----

is a Distressed Fund, save that such consent shall not be required where an
Event of Default is continuing;

(ii) obtain the prior written consent of the Parent (which may be given or refused
in its absolute discretion) before entering into any Participation with Voting
Rights, assignment or transfer to, with, involving or in favour of a person that
is (or would, upon becoming a Lender, be) an Industrial Competitor at the
time of such Participation with Voting Rights, assignment or transfer, save
that such consent shall not be required where an Event of Default is
continuing; and

(iii) during the Certain Funds Period, obtain the prior written consent of the
Parent (which may be given or refused in its absolute discretion) before
entering into any Participation with Voting Rights, assignment or transfer to,
with, involving or in favour of any person in respect of Facility B.

(d) The consent of the Parent to a Participation with Voting Rights, an assignment or
transfer must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Parent will be deemed to
have given its consent 10 Business Days after the Existing Lender has requested it
unless consent is expressly refused by the Parent within that time.

(e) The Agent shall, within 10 Business Days of a reasonable request by any Party,
provide a copy of the Pre-Approved New Lender List to that Party.

**27.3** **Other conditions of assignment or transfer**

(a) An assignment will only be effective on:

(i) receipt by the Agent (whether in the Assignment Agreement or otherwise) of
written confirmation from the New Lender (in form and substance
satisfactory to the Agent) that the New Lender will assume the same
obligations to the other Finance Parties and the other Secured Parties as it
would have been under if it was an Original Lender;

(ii) the New Lender entering into the documentation required for it to accede as a
party to the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(iii) the performance by the Agent of all necessary "know your customer" or other
similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations in relation to such
assignment to a New Lender, the completion of which the Agent shall
promptly notify to the Existing Lender and the New Lender.

(b) A transfer will only be effective if the New Lender enters into the documentation
required for it to accede as a party to the Intercreditor Agreement and if the procedure
set out in clause 27.6 (Procedure for transfer) is complied with.

(c) If:

(i) a Lender assigns or transfers any of its rights or obligations under the Finance
Documents or changes its Facility Office; and

(ii) as a result of circumstances existing at the date the assignment, transfer or
change occurs, an Obligor would be obliged to make a payment to the New


-----

Lender or Lender acting through its new Facility Office under clause 16 (Tax
_gross-up and indemnities) and clause 17 (Increased Costs),_

then the New Lender or Lender acting through its new Facility Office is only entitled
to receive payment under that clause to the same extent as the Existing Lender or
Lender acting through its previous Facility Office would have been if the assignment,
transfer or change had not occurred. This clause 27.3(c) shall not apply in respect of
an assignment or transfer made in the ordinary course of the primary syndication of
any Facility.

(d) Each New Lender, by executing the relevant Transfer Certificate or Assignment
Agreement, confirms, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Agent has authority to
execute on its behalf any amendment or waiver that has been approved by or on
behalf of the requisite Lender or Lenders in accordance with this Agreement on or
prior to the date on which the transfer or assignment becomes effective in accordance
with this Agreement and that it is bound by that decision to the same extent as the
Existing Lender would have been had it remained a Lender.

**27.4** **Assignment or transfer fee**

Unless the Agent otherwise agrees and excluding an assignment or transfer the New Lender
shall, on the date upon which an assignment or transfer takes effect, pay to the Agent (for its
own account) a fee of £3,500.

**27.5** **Limitation of responsibility of Existing Lenders**

(a) Unless expressly agreed to the contrary, an Existing Lender makes no representation
or warranty and assumes no responsibility to a New Lender for:

(i) the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of the
Transaction Documents, the Transaction Security or any other documents;

(ii) the financial condition of any Obligor;

(iii) the performance and observance by any Obligor or any other member of the
Group of its obligations under the Transaction Documents or any other
documents; or

(iv) the accuracy of any statements (whether written or oral) made in or in
connection with any Transaction Document or any other document,

and any representations or warranties implied by law are excluded.

(b) Each New Lender confirms to the Existing Lender, the other Finance Parties and the
Secured Parties that it:

(i) has made (and shall continue to make) its own independent investigation and
assessment of the financial condition and affairs of each Obligor and its
related entities in connection with its participation in this Agreement and has
not relied exclusively on any information provided to it by the Existing
Lender or any other Finance Party in connection with any Transaction
Document or the Transaction Security; and


-----

(ii) will continue to make its own independent appraisal of the creditworthiness
of each Obligor and its related entities whilst any amount is or may be
outstanding under the Finance Documents or any Commitment is in force.

(c) Nothing in any Finance Document obliges an Existing Lender to:

(i) accept a re-transfer or re-assignment from a New Lender of any of the rights
and obligations assigned or transferred under this clause 27; or

(ii) support any losses directly or indirectly incurred by the New Lender by
reason of the non-performance by any Obligor of its obligations under the
Transaction Documents or otherwise.

**27.6** **Procedure for transfer**

(a) Subject to the conditions set out in clause 27.2 (Parent consent) and clause 27.3

of this Agreement and delivered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,

(b) The Agent shall only be obliged to execute a Transfer Certificate delivered to it by
the Existing Lender and the New Lender once it is satisfied it has complied with all
necessary "know your customer" or similar checks under all applicable laws and
regulations in relation to the transfer to such New Lender.

(c) Subject to clause 27.11 (Pro rata interest settlement), on the Transfer Date:

(i) to the extent that in the Transfer Certificate the Existing Lender seeks to
transfer by novation its rights and obligations under the Finance Documents
and in respect of the Transaction Security each of the Obligors and the
Existing Lender shall be released from further obligations towards one
another under the Finance Documents and in respect of the Transaction
Security and their respective rights against one another under the Finance
Documents and in respect of the Transaction Security shall be cancelled
(being the "Discharged Rights and Obligations");

(ii) each of the Obligors and the New Lender shall assume obligations towards
one another and/or acquire rights against one another which differ from the
Discharged Rights and Obligations only insofar as that Obligor or other
member of the Group and the New Lender have assumed and/or acquired the
same in place of that Obligor and the Existing Lender;

(iii) the Agent, the Arrangers, the Security Agent, the New Lender, the other
Lenders and any relevant Ancillary Lender shall acquire the same rights and
assume the same obligations between themselves and in respect of the
Transaction Security as they would have acquired and assumed had the New
Lender been an Original Lender with the rights and/or obligations acquired or
assumed by it as a result of the transfer and to that extent the Agent, the
Arrangers, the Security Agent and any relevant Ancillary Lender and the

Existing Lender shall each be released from further obligations to each other
under the Finance Documents; and

Assignment Agreement delivered to it by the Existing Lender and the New Lender.
The Agent shall, subject to clause 27.7(b), as soon as reasonably practicable after
receipt by it of a duly completed Assignment Agreement appearing on its face to
comply with the terms of this Agreement and delivered in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, execute that Assignment Agreement.

(b) The Agent shall only be obliged to execute an Assignment Agreement delivered to it
by the Existing Lender and the New Lender once it is satisfied it has complied with
all necessary "know your customer" or similar checks under all applicable laws and
regulations in relation to the assignment to such New Lender.

(c) Subject to clause 27.11 (Pro rata interest settlement), on the Transfer Date:

(i) the Existing Lender will assign absolutely to the New Lender its rights under
the Finance Documents and in respect of the Transaction Security expressed
to be the subject of the assignment in the Assignment Agreement;

Agreement (and any corresponding obligations by which it is bound in
respect of the Transaction Security); and

(iii) the New Lender shall become a Party as a Lender and will be bound by
obligations equivalent to the Relevant Obligations.

(d) Lenders may utilise procedures other than those set out in this clause 27.7 to assign
their rights under the Finance Documents (but not, without the consent of the relevant
Obligor or unless in accordance with clause 27.6 (Procedure for transfer), to obtain a
release by that Obligor from the obligations owed to that Obligor by the Lenders nor
the assumption of equivalent obligations by a New Lender) **provided that they**

-----

accordance with clause 20.9 (Creditor Accession Undertaking) of the Intercreditor
Agreement.

**27.10** **Security over Lenders' rights**

In addition to the other rights provided to Lenders under this clause 27, each Lender may,
without consulting with or obtaining consent from any Obligor, at any time charge, assign or
otherwise create Security in or over (whether by way of collateral or otherwise) all or any of
its rights under any Finance Document to secure obligations of that Lender including, without
limitation:

(a) any charge, assignment or other Security to secure obligations to a federal reserve or
central bank; and

(b) any charge, assignment or other Security granted to any holders (or trustee or
representatives of holders) of obligations owed, or securities issued, by that Lender as
security for those obligations or securities,

except that no such charge, assignment or Security shall:

(i) release a Lender from any of its obligations under the Finance Documents or
substitute the beneficiary of the relevant charge, assignment or other Security
for the Lender as a party to any of the Finance Documents; or

(ii) require any payments to be made by an Obligor or grant to any person any
more extensive rights than those required to be made or granted to the
relevant Lender under the Finance Documents.

**27.11** **Pro rata interest settlement**

(a) If the Agent has notified the Lenders that it is able to distribute interest payments on a
"pro rata basis" to Existing Lenders and New Lenders then (in respect of any transfer
pursuant to clause 27.6 (Procedure for transfer) or any assignment pursuant to
clause 27.7 (Procedure for assignment) the Transfer Date of which, in each case, is

(i) any interest or fees in respect of the relevant participation which are
expressed to accrue by reference to the lapse of time shall continue to accrue
in favour of the Existing Lender up to but excluding the Transfer Date
("Accrued Amounts") and shall become due and payable to the Existing

current Interest Period (or, if the Interest Period is longer than six Months, on
the next of the dates which falls at six Monthly intervals after the first day of
that Interest Period); and

(ii) the rights assigned or transferred by the Existing Lender will not include the
right to the Accrued Amounts so that, for the avoidance of doubt:

(A) when the Accrued Amounts become payable, those Accrued
Amounts will be payable for the account of the Existing Lender; and

(B) the amount payable to the New Lender on that date will be the
amount which would, but for the application of this clause 27.11,


-----

have been payable to it on that date, but after deduction of the
Accrued Amounts.

(b) In this clause 27.11 references to "Interest Period" shall be construed to include a
reference to any other period for accrual of fees.

(c) An Existing Lender which retains the right to the Accrued Amounts pursuant to this
clause 27.11 but which does not have a Commitment shall be deemed not to be a
Lender for the purposes of ascertaining whether the agreement of any specified group
of Lenders has been obtained to approve any request for a consent, waiver,
amendment or other vote of Lenders under the Finance Documents.

**28.** **RESTRICTION ON DEBT PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS**

unanimity) of the Total Commitments; or

(2) the agreement of any specified group of Lenders,

has been obtained to approve any request for a consent, waiver,
amendment or other vote under the Finance Documents,

such Commitment shall be deemed to be zero and such Sponsor Affiliate or
the person with whom it has entered into such sub-participation, other
agreement or arrangement shall be deemed not to be a Lender for the
purposes of clauses 28.2(a)(ii)(A) and 28.2(a)(ii)(B) (unless in the case of a
person not being a Sponsor Affiliate it is a Lender by virtue otherwise than by
beneficially owning the relevant Commitment).

(b) Each Lender shall, unless such Debt Purchase Transaction is an assignment or
transfer, promptly notify the Agent in writing if it knowingly enters into a Debt


-----

Purchase Transaction with a Sponsor Affiliate (a **"Notifiable Debt Purchase**

Any Sponsor Affiliate which is or becomes a Lender and which enters into a Debt Purchase
Transaction as a purchaser or a participant shall, by 5.00pm on the Business Day following

(b) The Agent shall notify the Parent and the Lenders promptly upon being satisfied that
it has received (in form and substance satisfactory to it) all the documents and other
evidence listed in part 3 of schedule 2 (Conditions precedent).

(c) Other than to the extent that the Majority Lenders notify the Agent in writing to the
contrary before the Agent gives the notification described in clause 29.2(b), the
Lenders authorise (but do not require) the Agent to give that notification. The Agent
shall not be liable for any damages, costs or losses whatsoever as a result of giving
any such notification.

**29.3** **Resignation of a Borrower**

In this clause 29.3, clause 29.5 (Resignation of a Guarantor) and clause 29.7 (Resignation
_and release of security on disposal),_ **"Third Party Disposal" means the disposal of an**
Obligor to a person which is not a member of the Group where that disposal is permitted
under clause 25.18 (Disposals) or made with the approval of the Majority Lenders and the
Majority Super Senior Lenders (and the Parent has confirmed this is the case).

Borrower (other than the Parent or the Company) ceases to be a Borrower by
delivering to the Agent a Resignation Letter.

Finance Parties of its acceptance if:

(i) the Parent has confirmed that no Default is continuing or would result from
the acceptance of the Resignation Letter;

(ii) the Borrower is under no actual or contingent obligations as a Borrower
under any Finance Documents;

(iii) where the Borrower is also a Guarantor (unless its resignation has been

and enforceable and in full force and effect (subject to the Legal
Reservations) and the amount guaranteed by it as a Guarantor is not
decreased (and the Parent has confirmed this is the case); and

(iv) the Parent has confirmed that any relevant Disposal Proceeds will be applied
in accordance with clause 10.2 (Acquisition, Disposal and Insurance
_Proceeds)._

or obligations under the Finance Documents as a Borrower except that the resignation


-----

shall not take effect (and the Borrower will continue to have rights and obligations
under the Finance Documents) until the date on which the Third Party Disposal takes
effect.

(d) The Agent may, at the cost and expense of the Parent, require a legal opinion from
counsel to the Agent confirming the matters set out in clause 29.3(b)(iii) and the
Agent shall be under no obligation to accept a Resignation Letter until it has obtained
such opinion in form and substance satisfactory to it.

the Agent's liability, any liability of the Agent arising under or in connection with any

Agent to become a party to this Agreement as Agent) agree with the proposed
successor Agent amendments to this clause 30 and any other term of this Agreement
dealing with the rights or obligations of the Agent consistent with then current market
practice for the appointment and protection of corporate trustees together with any
reasonable amendments to the agency fee payable under this Agreement which are
consistent with the successor Agent's normal fee rates and those amendments will
bind the Parties.

records and provide such assistance as the successor Agent may reasonably request
for the purposes of performing its functions as Agent under the Finance Documents.

FATCA Application Date relating to any payment to the Agent under the Finance
Documents, either:

will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA
Application Date;

(ii) the information supplied by the Agent pursuant to clause 16.8 (FATCA
_Information) indicates that the Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be) a_

will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA
Application Date,

and (in each case) a Lender reasonably believes that a Party will be required to make

and records and provide such assistance as the successor Agent may reasonably
request for the purposes of performing its functions as Agent under the Finance
Documents.

**SECTION 11**

**ADMINISTRATION**

**33.** **PAYMENT MECHANICS**

**33.1** **Payments to the Agent**

(a) On each date on which an Obligor or a Lender is required to make a payment under a
Finance Document, excluding a payment under the terms of an Ancillary Document,
that Obligor or Lender shall make the same available to the Agent (unless a contrary
indication appears in a Finance Document) for value on the due date at the time and
in such funds specified by the Agent as being customary at the time for settlement of
transactions in the relevant currency in the place of payment.

(b) Payment shall be made to such account in the principal financial centre of the country
of that currency (or, in relation to euro, in a principal financial centre in such
Participating Member State or London, as specified by the Agent) and with such bank
as the Agent, in each case, specifies.

**33.2** **Distributions by the Agent**

Each payment received by the Agent under the Finance Documents for another Party shall,
subject to clause 33.3 (Distributions to an Obligor) and clause 33.4 (Clawback and
_pre-funding) be made available by the Agent as soon as practicable after receipt to the Party_
entitled to receive payment in accordance with this Agreement (in the case of a Lender, for
the account of its Facility Office), to such account as that Party may notify to the Agent by
not less than five Business Days' notice with a bank specified by that Party in the principal
financial centre of the country of that currency (or, in relation to euro, in the principal
financial centre of a Participating Member State or London, as specified by that Party).

**33.3** **Distributions to an Obligor**

The Agent may (with the consent of the Obligor or in accordance with clause 34 (Set-off))
apply any amount received by it for that Obligor in or towards payment (on the date and in
the currency and funds of receipt) of any amount due from that Obligor under the Finance
Documents or in or towards purchase of any amount of any currency to be so applied.

**33.4** **Clawback and pre-funding**

(a) Where a sum is to be paid to the Agent under the Finance Documents for another
Party, the Agent is not obliged to pay that sum to that other Party (or to enter into or
perform any related exchange contract) until it has been able to establish to its
satisfaction that it has actually received that sum.

(b) Unless clause 33.4(c) applies, if the Agent pays an amount to another Party and it
proves to be the case that the Agent had not actually received that amount, then the
Party to whom that amount (or the proceeds of any related exchange contract) was
paid by the Agent shall on demand refund the same to the Agent together with
interest on that amount from the date of payment to the date of receipt by the Agent,
calculated by the Agent to reflect its cost of funds.

(c) If the Agent has notified the Lenders that it is willing to make available amounts for
the account of a Borrower before receiving funds from the Lenders then if and to the


-----

extent that the Agent does so but it proves to be the case that it does not then receive
funds from a Lender in respect of a sum which it paid to a Borrower:

(i) the Agent shall notify the Parent of that Lender's identity and the Borrower to
whom that sum was made available shall on demand refund it to the
Agent; and

(ii) the Lender by whom those funds should have been made available or, if that
Lender fails to do so, the Borrower to whom that sum was made available,
shall on demand pay to the Agent the amount (as certified by the Agent)
which will indemnify the Agent against any funding cost incurred by it as a
result of paying out that sum before receiving those funds from that Lender.

**33.5** **Impaired Agent**

(a) If, at any time, the Agent becomes an Impaired Agent, an Obligor or a Lender which
is required to make a payment under the Finance Documents to the Agent in
accordance with clause 33.1 (Payments to the Agent) may instead either:

(i) pay that amount direct to the required recipient(s); or

(ii) if in its absolute discretion it considers that it is not reasonably practicable to
pay that amount direct to the required recipient(s), pay that amount or the
relevant part of that amount to an interest-bearing account held with an
Acceptable Bank within the meaning of paragraph (a) of the definition of
**"Acceptable Bank" and in relation to which no Insolvency Event has**
occurred and is continuing, in the name of the Obligor or the Lender making
the payment (the "Paying Party") and designated as a trust account for the
benefit of the Party or Parties beneficially entitled to that payment under the
Finance Documents (the "Recipient Party" or "Recipient Parties").

In each case such payments must be made on the due date for payment under the
Finance Documents.

(b) All interest accrued on the amount standing to the credit of the trust account shall be
for the benefit of the Recipient Party or the Recipient Parties _pro rata to their_
respective entitlements.

(c) A Party which has made a payment in accordance with this clause 33.5 shall be
discharged of the relevant payment obligation under the Finance Documents and shall
not take any credit risk with respect to the amounts standing to the credit of the trust
account.

(d) Promptly upon the appointment of a successor Agent in accordance with clause 30.13
(Replacement of the Agent), each Paying Party shall (other than to the extent that that
Party has given an instruction pursuant to clause 33.5(e)) give all requisite
instructions to the bank with whom the trust account is held to transfer the amount
(together with any accrued interest) to the successor Agent for distribution to the
relevant Recipient Party or Recipient Parties in accordance with clause 33.2
(Distributions by the Agent).

(e) A Paying Party shall, promptly upon request by a Recipient Party and to the extent:

(i) that it has not given an instruction pursuant to clause 33.5(d); and


-----

(ii) that it has been provided with the necessary information by that Recipient
Party,

give all requisite instructions to the bank with whom the trust account is held to
transfer the relevant amount (together with any accrued interest) to that Recipient
Party.

**33.6** **Partial payments**

(a) If the Agent receives a payment for application against amounts due in respect of any
Finance Documents that is insufficient to discharge all amounts then due and payable
by an Obligor under those Finance Documents, the Agent shall apply that payment
towards the obligations of that Obligor under those Finance Documents in the
following order:

(i) **first, in or towards payment** _pro rata of any unpaid amount owing to the_
Agent or the Security Agent under the Finance Documents;

(ii) **secondly, in or towards payment** _pro rata of any accrued interest, fee or_
commission due but unpaid under the Finance Documents;

(iii) **thirdly, in or towards payment** _pro rata of any principal due but unpaid_
under the Finance Documents; and

(iv) **fourthly, in or towards payment** _pro rata of any other sum due but unpaid_
under the Finance Documents.

Lenders, vary the order set out in clauses 33.6(a)(ii) to 33.6(a)(iii).

be made without (and free and clear of any deduction for) set-off or counterclaim.

**33.8** **Business Days**

not a Business Day shall be made on the next Business Day in the same calendar
month (if there is one) or the preceding Business Day (if there is not).

(b) During any extension of the due date for payment of any principal or Unpaid Sum
under this Agreement interest is payable on the principal or Unpaid Sum at the rate
payable on the original due date.

**33.9** **Currency of account**

(a) Subject to clauses 33.9(b) to 33.9(e), the Base Currency is the currency of account
and payment for any sum due from an Obligor under any Finance Document shall be
due in the Base Currency.

made in the currency in which that Loan or Unpaid Sum is denominated, pursuant to

which the interest is payable was denominated, pursuant to this Agreement, when that
interest accrued.

(d) Each payment in respect of costs, expenses or Taxes shall be made in the currency in
which the costs, expenses or Taxes are incurred.

(e) Any amount expressed to be payable in a currency other than the Base Currency shall

**33.10** **Change of currency**

(a) Unless otherwise prohibited by law, if more than one currency or currency unit are at
the same time recognised by the central bank of any country as the lawful currency of
that country, then:

(i) any reference in the Finance Documents to, and any obligations arising under
the Finance Documents in, the currency of that country shall be translated
into, or paid in, the currency or currency unit of that country designated by
the Agent (after consultation with the Parent); and

official rate of exchange recognised by the central bank for the conversion of
that currency or currency unit into the other, rounded up or down by the
Agent (acting reasonably).

(b) If a change in any currency of a country occurs, this Agreement will, to the extent the
Agent (acting reasonably and after consultation with the Parent) specifies to be
necessary, be amended to comply with any generally accepted conventions and
market practice in the Relevant Market and otherwise to reflect the change in
currency.

administration of the Facilities as the Agent may deem necessary in the
circumstances;

(b) the Agent shall not be obliged to consult with the Parent in relation to any changes

(e) the Agent shall not be liable for any damages, costs or losses to any person, any
diminution in value or any liability whatsoever (including, without limitation for

are in different currencies, the Finance Party may convert either obligation at a
market rate of exchange in its usual course of business for the purpose of the set-off.

(b) Any credit balances taken into account by an Ancillary Lender when operating a net

then any Lender who does not and continues not to consent or agree to such waiver or
amendment shall be deemed a "Non-Consenting Lender".

**SCHEDULE 12:** **AGREED SECURITY PRINCIPLES**

1. **Considerations**

In determining what Security will be provided in support of the Facilities (and any related
hedging arrangements documented by way of Hedging Agreements) the following matters
will be taken into account. Security shall not be created or perfected to the extent that it
would:

(a) result in any breach of corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference or
thin capitalisation laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable
jurisdiction;

(b) result in a significant risk to the officers of the relevant grantor of Security of
contravention of their fiduciary duties and/or of civil or criminal liability; or

(c) result in costs that, in the opinion of the Agent, are disproportionate to the benefit
obtained by the beneficiaries of that Security.

For the avoidance of doubt, in these Agreed Security Principles, "cost" includes, but is not
limited to, income tax cost, registration taxes payable on the creation or enforcement or for
the continuance of any Security, stamp duties, out-of-pocket expenses, and other fees and
expenses directly incurred by the relevant grantor of Security or any of its direct or indirect
owners, subsidiaries or Affiliates.

2. **Obligations to be Secured**

Subject to paragraph 1 (Considerations), the obligations to be secured are the Secured
Obligations (as defined below). The Security is to be granted in favour of the Security Agent
on behalf of each Lender from time to time and the Agent, the Arranger, and any Hedge
Counterparty.

For ease of reference, the following definitions should, to the extent legally possible, be
incorporated into each Transaction Security Document (with the capitalised terms used in
them having the meaning given to them in the Intercreditor Agreement):

**"Secured Obligations" means all present and future obligations and liabilities (whether**
actual or contingent and whether owed jointly or severally or alone or in any other capacity
whatsoever) of each member of the Group to the Security Agent and/or the other Secured
Parties (or any of them) under or pursuant to any Finance Document (including all monies
covenanted to be paid under this Deed).

**"Secured Parties" means the Security Agent, any Receiver or Delegate and each of the**
Primary Creditors from time to time but, in the case of each Primary Creditor, only if it is a
party to the Intercreditor Agreement or has acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement, in the
appropriate capacity, pursuant to clause 20.9 (Creditor Accession Undertaking) of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The secured obligations will be limited:

(a) to avoid any breach of corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference,
thin capitalisation rules or the laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any
applicable jurisdiction; and


-----

(b) to avoid any risk to officers of the relevant member of the Group that is granting
Transaction Security of contravention of their fiduciary duties and/or civil or criminal
or personal liability.

3. **General**

Where appropriate, defined terms in the Transaction Security Documents should mirror those
in this Agreement.

The parties to this Agreement agree to negotiate the form of each Transaction Security
Document in good faith and will ensure that all documentation required to be entered into as a
condition precedent to first drawdown under this Agreement (or immediately thereafter) is in
a finally agreed form as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement. The
form of guarantee is set out in clause 21 (Guarantee and indemnity) of this Agreement and,
with respect to any Additional Guarantor, is subject to any limitations set out in the Accession
Deed applicable to such Additional Guarantor.

The Security shall, to the extent possible under local law, be enforceable on the occurrence of
a Declared Default.

4. **Undertakings/Representations and Warranties**

Any representations, warranties or undertakings which are required to be included in any
Transaction Security Document shall reflect (to the extent to which the subject matter of such
representation, warranty or undertaking is the same as the corresponding representation,
warranty or undertaking in this Agreement) the commercial deal set out in this Agreement
(save to the extent that Secured Parties' local counsel deem it necessary to include any further
provisions (or deviate from those contained in this Agreement) in order to protect or preserve
the Security granted to the Secured Parties).

5. **Other**

(a) Prior to the occurrence of a Declared Default which is continuing:

(i) the grantor of any Security over shares will be permitted to retain legal title to
such shares, to retain and exercise voting rights in respect of the relevant
shares and to receive all distributions from such shares (unless local law or
market standard practice in the relevant jurisdiction requires legal title to pass
to the Security Agent, a Finance Party or its or their nominees in order to
achieve valid or perfected Security);

(ii) proceeds of any insurances shall be dealt with by the relevant Obligor as
permitted under the Agreement;

(iii) receivables and all bank accounts (other than any Mandatory Prepayment
Accounts or Holding Accounts) may be dealt with by an Obligor in the
ordinary course of its business;

(iv) no notices shall be served on the counterparty of any charged contract who is
not a member of the Group save for an Acquisition Agreement; and

(v) no notice by attaching a notice to fixed assets or inventory shall be prepared
or given.


-----

(b) The provisions of any Transaction Security Document granted by a company
incorporated in England and Wales after the Closing Date will be substantially the
same as the provisions of the corresponding Transaction Security Document granted
by the Original Obligors.

(c) No mortgages will be taken over any Real Property unless such Real Property is
freehold property or leasehold property which is not leased on a rack rent basis (in
each case "Material Property") and there shall be no obligation to investigate title,
provide valuations, surveys or other due diligence unless in relation to Material
Property with a value in excess of £100,000.

(d) To the extent possible and provided not required by local law or market standard
practice in any relevant jurisdiction, there should be no action required to be taken in
relation to any guarantee or Security when any Lender transfers any of its
participation in the Facilities to a new Lender.

6. **Transaction Security Documents governed by Dutch law (granted after the Closing**
**Date)**

(a) Shares: the (enforcement of) Transaction Security Document created over the shares
in the capital of any Dutch Obligor will not be limited by any transfer restrictions
(blokkeringsregeling) contained in the articles of association of any Dutch Obligor.

(b) Receivables (including intercompany receivables, trade receivables and insurance
receivables and in relation to the Company, Acquisition Documents):

## (i) The perfection of receivables security granted will not be required until the
occurrence of an Enforcement Event has occurred, other than in respect of
intra-Group receivables or where such notification is required by applicable
law to create Transaction Security.

## (ii) Until an Enforcement Event the Obligor providing the Security is permitted
to receive any payment under its receivables to the extent permitted under the
Finance Documents.

## (iii) If required by or customary under local law to perfect the security, notice of
the security will be served on the relevant counterparty within five Business
Days of the security being granted and the Obligor shall use its reasonable
endeavours (not involving the payment of money or incurrence of any
external expenses) to obtain an acknowledgement of that within 20 Business
Days of service.

## (iv) In respect of Transaction Security (to be) created over bank account
(receivables) maintained with Dutch financial institutions, each relevant
Obligor will use best efforts to obtain the consent of such bank prior to the on
the date of execution of the deed of pledge creating the Transaction Security.
