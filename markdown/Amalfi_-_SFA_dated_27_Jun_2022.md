indebtedness, loan, investment, disposal, guarantee, payment or other transaction
is permitted to be incurred or made under the terms of this agreement or any other
Finance Document, the Adjusted EBITDA threshold as at the date such new
indebtedness, loan, investment, disposal, guarantee, payment or other transaction
is to be incurred or made shall apply.

(d) If any amount or transaction meets the criteria of more than one of the baskets or
exceptions set out in this agreement, the Company (in its sole discretion) will classify
and may from time to time reclassify that amount or transaction to a particular
basket or exception and will only be required to include that amount or transaction
in one of those baskets or exceptions (and, for the avoidance of doubt, an amount
or transaction may at the option of the Company be split between different baskets
or exceptions).

Financial Indebtedness and when calculating any financial definitions and/or calculations

or capital lease if that lease, hire purchase contract, concession, license or (as the case may
be) other arrangement (or guarantee) was treated (or would have been permitted to be
treated) as an operating lease in accordance with the Accounting Principles as applied by
members of the Group prior to 1 January 2019 (and the applicable effects of IFRS 16 on
and from 1 January 2019 will be disregarded in respect of such leases (including for the
avoidance of doubt for all purposes under this agreement and including with respect to the
calculation of EBITDA)).

EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

(f) The Increase Lender shall, on the date upon which the increase takes effect, pay to
the Facility Agent (for its own account) a fee in an amount equal to the fee which

a transfer pursuant to clause 29.9 (Procedure for transfer) and if the Increase Lender
was a New Lender.

(g) The Parent may pay (or may procure that another Obligor pays) to the Increase

to the relevant increase;

(ii) the "New Lender" were references to that "Increase Lender"; and

(iii) a "re-transfer" and "re-assignment" were references to respectively a

Proportion of the participation in a Senior Term Facility A Loan or a Senior
Term Facility B Loan (as applicable) which the Original Committed Lenders
are required to make available pursuant to clause 5.4 (Lenders' participation)
(an "Alternative Lender Funded Amount"), to assume a Senior Term
Facility A Commitment or Senior Term Facility B Commitment (as applicable)
in an amount equal to that Alternative Lender Funded Amount (an
"Alternative Lender Assumed Commitment") and to make its
participation in a Senior Term Facility A Loan or Senior Term Facility B Loan
(as applicable) available in an amount in cash in immediately available cleared
funds equal to that Alternative Lender Funded Amount (an "Alternative

Committed Lenders;

(ii) the Facility Agent shall apply the proceeds of each Alternative Lender Funded

80
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

(A) each Alternative Lender Assumed Commitment shall be attributed to
the relevant Electing Alternative Lender as if it had been an Original
Committed Lender in respect of that Alternative Lender Assumed

the relevant Original Committed Lender) (and such Electing Alternative
Lenders shall constitute an "Alternative Committed Lender"); and

(i) not be a Defaulting Lender; and

Commitments (as applicable) of the Committed Lenders) shall not be required
to make its participation (in an amount equal to the Alternative Lender Funded
Amount) in the relevant Senior Term Facility A Loan or Senior Term Facility B

Alternative Lender which becomes an Alternative Committed Lender in
accordance with paragraph (a)(iii)(A) above, each Original Committed Lender
(on a several basis pro rata in accordance with the respective Senior Term
Facility A Commitments or Senior Term Facility B Commitments (as applicable)
of the Original Committed Lenders) shall be required to make its participation
in the relevant Senior Term Facility A Loan or Senior Term Facility B Loan (as
applicable) available in accordance with the Senior Term Facility A
Commitment or Senior Term Facility B Commitment (as applicable) of such

81
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

Commitments held by the Original Super Senior Term Facility Lenders as at the

Original Super Senior Term Facility Lender shall, following such reclassification,
be a Lender under Senior Term Facility A; or

shall be automatically cancelled;

(b) the aggregate participations of the Original Super Senior Term Facility Lenders in
any Super Senior Term Facility Loans (the "Residual Super Senior Term Facility

reclassified as a Senior Term Facility A Loan with an Interest Period ending on the
same date as the Interest Period applicable to the Residual Super Senior Term Facility
Loans (the "Reclassified Super Senior Term Facility Loan"); and

(c) any accrued but unpaid interest in respect of the Residual Super Senior Term Facility
Loans as at the Syndication Date shall be paid at the end of the Interest Period
relating to the Reclassified Super Senior Term Facility Loan (and for the avoidance

Super Senior Term Facility Loan at the rate applicable to Senior Term Facility A).

2.6 Optional Reclassification of Senior Term Facility B

forma adjustments referred to in the definition of "Adjusted Leverage" in clause 26.1
(Financial Definitions)) is less than or equal to 5.75:1 (or otherwise with the consent
of the Facility Agent and all Lenders under Senior Term Facility B) the Parent may,
by giving no less than ten Business Days' notice to the Facility Agent request that all
or part of the Senior Term Facility B Loans (but if in part, being an amount not less

Senior Term Facility B Loans) (the "Residual Senior Term Facility B Loans") be
reclassified as Senior Term Facility A Loans.

the date of such request (the "Reclassification Date"):

reclassified as Senior Term Facility A Commitments;

(ii) each Lender under each Residual Senior Term Facility B Loan shall, following

Period relating to such Reclassified Senior Term Facility B Loans (and for the
avoidance of doubt, on and from the Reclassification Date, interest shall
accrue on such Reclassified Senior Term Facility B Loans at the rate applicable
to Senior Term Facility A).

82
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

clause 26.1 (Financial definitions) and where, for this purpose only, the Relevant
Period for the purpose of the definition of Relevant Period is the period of 12 months
ending on or around the date falling six months after the Closing Date) is greater
than 5.75:1 (a "Mandatory Conversion Event"), the date falling six months after
the Closing Date; and

(b) the date falling 18 months after the Closing Date,

(such earlier date being, the "Mandatory Reclassification Date"), the parties agree that:

the Interest Period relating to such Reclassified Senior Term Facility B Loans
(and for the avoidance of doubt, on and from the Mandatory Reclassification
Date, interest shall accrue on such Reclassified Senior Term Facility B Loans
at the rate applicable to Senior Term Facility A); and

2.8 Finance Parties' rights and obligations

of its relevant Affiliate in the circumstances described in paragraph (e) of clause 7.8
(Affiliates of Lenders as Ancillary Lenders)).

83
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

(b) The rights of each Finance Party under or in connection with the Finance Documents
are separate and independent rights and any debt arising under the Finance
Documents to a Finance Party from an Obligor is a separate and independent debt
in respect of which a Finance Party shall be entitled to enforce its rights in accordance
with paragraph (c) below. The rights of each Finance Party include any debt owing
to that Finance Party under the Finance Documents and, for the avoidance of doubt,
any part of a Loan or any other amount owed by an Obligor which relates to a Finance
Party's participation in a Facility or its role under a Finance Document (including any
such amount payable to the Facility Agent on its behalf) is a debt owing to that
Finance Party by that Obligor.

(c) A Finance Party may, except as specifically provided in the Finance Documents,
separately enforce its rights under or in connection with the Finance Documents.

2.9 Obligors' Agent

authorised signatories) to act on its behalf as its agent in relation to the Finance
Documents and irrevocably authorises:

(i) the Parent on its behalf to supply all information concerning itself
contemplated by this agreement to the Finance Parties and to give all notices
and instructions (including, in the case of a Borrower, Utilisation Requests),
to agree any Incremental Term Facility Terms and to deliver any Incremental
Term Facility Notice, to make such agreements and to effect the relevant
amendments, supplements and variations (in each case, however
fundamental) capable of being given, made or effected by any Obligor
(notwithstanding that they may increase the Obligor's obligations or otherwise
affect the Obligor) and to give confirmation as to continuation of surety
obligations, without further reference to or the consent of that Obligor; and

(ii) each Finance Party to give any notice, demand or other communication to
that Obligor pursuant to the Finance Documents to the Parent,

and in each case the Obligor shall be bound as though the Obligor itself had given
the notices and instructions (including, without limitation, any Utilisation Requests)
or executed or made the agreements or effected the amendments, supplements or
variations, or received the relevant notice, demand or other communication.

(b) Every act, omission, agreement, undertaking, settlement, waiver, amendment,
supplement, variation, notice or other communication given or made by the Obligors'
Agent or given to the Obligors' Agent under any Finance Document on behalf of
another Obligor or in connection with any Finance Document (whether or not known
to any other Obligor and whether occurring before or after such other Obligor became
an Obligor under any Finance Document) shall be binding for all purposes on that
Obligor as if that Obligor had expressly made, given or concurred with it. In the
event of any conflict between any notices or other communications of the Obligors'
Agent and any other Obligor, those of the Obligors' Agent shall prevail.

of Ancillary Facilities provided by that Ancillary Lender (or by its Affiliate)

accrued interest, fees and commission owed to it (or to its Affiliate) as an
Ancillary Lender in respect of the Ancillary Facility); and

demand), each Lender and each Ancillary Lender shall (subject to paragraph (g)
below) promptly adjust (by making or receiving (as the case may be) corresponding
transfers of rights and obligations under the Finance Documents relating to Revolving
Outstandings) their claims in respect of amounts outstanding to them under the

Facility bear the same proportion to the Total Revolving Outstandings as such
Lender's Revolving Facility Commitment under the Revolving Facility bears to the

adjustment is made under paragraph (b) above, then each Lender and Ancillary
Lender will make a further adjustment (by making or receiving (as the case may be)
corresponding transfers of rights and obligations under the Finance Documents
relating to Revolving Outstandings to the extent necessary) to put themselves in the
position they would have been in had the original adjustment been determined by
reference to the actual liability or, as the case may be, zero liability and not the
contingent liability.

(d) Any transfer of rights and obligations relating to Revolving Outstandings made
pursuant to this clause 7.6 shall be made for a purchase price in cash, payable at
the time of transfer, in an amount equal to those Revolving Outstandings (less any
accrued interest, fees and commission to which the transferor will remain entitled to

97

receive notwithstanding that transfer, pursuant to clause 29.14 (Pro rata interest

or in another currency which is acceptable to that Lender.

7.7 Information

Each Borrower and each Ancillary Lender shall, promptly upon request by the Facility Agent,
supply the Facility Agent with any information relating to the operation of an Ancillary
Facility (including the Ancillary Outstandings) as the Facility Agent may reasonably request
from time to time. Each Borrower consents to all such information being released to the
Facility Agent and the other Finance Parties.

7.8 Affiliates of Lenders as Ancillary Lenders

(a) Subject to the terms of this agreement, an Affiliate of a Lender may become an
Ancillary Lender. In such case, the Lender and its Affiliate shall be treated as a single

to the Revolving Facility and/or the amount of any Revolving Facility Commitment
transferred to or assumed by that Lender under this agreement, to the extent (in
each case) not cancelled, reduced or transferred by it under this agreement.

(b) The Parent shall specify any relevant Affiliate of a Lender in any notice delivered by
the Parent to the Facility Agent pursuant to paragraph (b)(i) of clause 7.2

(c) If a Lender assigns all of its rights and benefits or transfers all of its rights and
obligations to a New Lender, its Affiliate shall cease to have any obligations under
this agreement or any Ancillary Document.

Intercreditor Agreement as an Ancillary Lender and any person which so accedes to
the Intercreditor Agreement shall, at the same time, become a Party as an "Ancillary
Lender" in accordance with clause 21.11 (Creditor Accession Undertaking) of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

(e) Where this agreement or any other Finance Document imposes an obligation on an

performed by its Affiliate.

clause 31.3 (Resignation of a Borrower), its Affiliate shall cease to have any rights
under this agreement or any Ancillary Document.

Borrower under an Ancillary Facility and the relevant Borrower is an Affiliate of a
Borrower which is not a party to that document, the relevant Borrower shall ensure
that the obligation is performed by its Affiliate.

(e) Any reference in this agreement or any other Finance Document to a Borrower being
under no obligations (whether actual or contingent) as a Borrower under such
Finance Document shall be construed to include a reference to any Affiliate of a
Borrower being under no obligations under any Finance Document or Ancillary
Document.

7.10 Revolving Facility Commitment amounts

Notwithstanding any other term of this agreement, each Lender shall ensure that at all
times its Revolving Facility Commitment is not less than:

(b) where relevant, the Ancillary Commitment of its Affiliate,

made available under such Term Facility.

7.11 Amendments and waivers â Ancillary Facilities

No amendment or waiver of a term of any Ancillary Facility shall require the consent of any
Finance Party other than the relevant Ancillary Lender unless such amendment or waiver
itself relates to or gives rise to a matter which would require an amendment of or under
this agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, under this clause 7). In such a case,
clause 41 (Amendments and waivers) will apply.

(A) on the same day that a maturing Revolving Facility Loan is due to be

(bb) each Lender will be required to make a payment under clause
35.1 (Payments to the Facility Agent) in respect of its
participation in the new Revolving Facility Loans only to the

Facility Loan and the remainder of that Lender's participation in
the new Revolving Facility Loans shall be treated as having been
made available and applied by the Borrower in or towards
repayment of that Lender's participation in the maturing
Revolving Facility Loan.

the maturity date of each of the participations of that Lender in the Revolving Facility
Loans then outstanding under such Revolving Facility will be automatically extended
to the Termination Date applicable to such Revolving Facility and will be treated as
separate Revolving Facility Loans under such Revolving Facility (the "Separate
Loans") denominated in the currency in which the relevant participations are
outstanding.

(d) If the Borrower makes a prepayment of a Revolving Facility Loan pursuant to clause

The proportion borne by the amount of the prepayment of the Separate Loan to the
amount of the Separate Loans shall not exceed the proportion borne by the amount
of the prepayment of a Revolving Facility Loan to the Revolving Facility Loans, in
each case, under the Revolving Facility. The Facility Agent will forward a copy of a
prepayment notice received in accordance with this paragraph (d) to the Defaulting
Lender concerned as soon as practicable on receipt.

Loan.

continue to apply to Separate Loans other than to the extent inconsistent with

(b)(ii) of this clause 13.12, as the context requires;

"Relevant Prepayment" means a prepayment of all or any part of a Senior Term
Facility A Loan (including, for the avoidance of doubt, but subject to paragraphs (A)

to the date falling 18 months after the Closing Date of all or any part
of a Senior Term Facility B Loan which has been reclassified as a Senior
Term Facility A Loan in accordance with paragraph (a) of clause 2.7
(Mandatory Reclassification of Senior Term Facility B) (the "Converted

(and no prepayment fee shall be paid with respect to such prepayment);
and

(B) for the purposes of this definition only, any Converted Facility B
Prepayment shall be deemed to be applied in prepayment of the
Converted Facility B Amount until that Converted Facility B Amount has
been prepaid in full, rather than being applied across all Senior Term
Facility A Loans (including the Converted Facility B Amount) pro rata;

"Relevant Prepayment Amount" shall have the meaning given to it in paragraph
(b)(i) or (b)(ii) of this clause 13.12, as the context requires;

(b) Calculation of Senior Term Facility A Prepayment Fees

(i) If, between the Closing Date and the Last Day of the Non Call Period (such
period constituting a "Prepayment Period") there is a Relevant Prepayment,
the principal amount of which, when aggregated with the principal amount of
all other Relevant Prepayments previously made in that Prepayment Period
exceeds an aggregate amount equal to the Prepayment Deductible (the
amount of such Relevant Prepayment which is in excess of the amount of the
Prepayment Deductible for that Prepayment Period being the "Relevant
Prepayment Amount"), that Relevant Prepayment may only be made if, in
addition to all other sums required to be paid under this agreement in

(such period constituting a "Prepayment Period") there is a Relevant
Prepayment, the principal amount of which, when aggregated with the
principal amount of all other Relevant Prepayments previously made in that
Prepayment Period exceeds an aggregate amount equal to the Prepayment
Deductible (the amount of such Relevant Prepayment which is in excess of
the amount of the Prepayment Deductible for that Prepayment Period being
the "Relevant Prepayment Amount"), that Relevant Prepayment may only
be made if, in addition to all other sums required to be paid under this
agreement in connection with such Relevant Prepayment, the Parent (or
another Obligor) pays to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Senior Term
Facility A Lenders) a prepayment fee of two per cent of the Relevant
Prepayment Amount.

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, no premium or fee shall be payable under
paragraphs (i) or (ii) above in relation to any prepayment made pursuant to:

(A) clause 10.1 (Illegality);

(B) clause 11.2 (Disposal, Insurance, Listing and Acquisition Proceeds),

Facility A where such Senior Term Facility A Lender's participation in
that refinancing (including any participation in that refinancing of its
Affiliates or Related Funds) is at least equal to the aggregate
Commitments under Senior Term Facility A of such Senior Term Facility
A Lender and its Affiliates and Related Funds as at the date of such
refinancing. If, following the refinancing of Senior Term Facility A, the
aggregate Commitments of a Senior Term Facility A Lender and its
Affiliates and Related Funds is less than the aggregate Commitments
of that Senior Term Facility A Lender and its Affiliates and Related
Funds under Senior Term Facility A as at the date of such refinancing
(such difference being the "Commitments Shortfall"), then that
Senior Term Facility A Lender and its Affiliates and Related Funds shall
receive (pro rata to their Commitments under Senior Term Facility A)
a prepayment fee calculated in accordance with paragraph (b) above
and where the amount prepaid shall be treated for these purposes as
the Commitments Shortfall; or

(B) any prepayment which constitutes a Converted Facility B Prepayment
which is made on or prior to the date falling 18 months after the Closing
Date.

-----

(a) Subject to the other provisions in this clause 14.3 and to clause 41.8 (ESG
amendments), provided that the Facility Agent has received the ESG Compliance
Certificate for the most recently ended Ratings Period in accordance with clause 25.5
(ESG Information) and provided further that no Event of Default has occurred, the
applicable Margin for a Senior Term Facility A Loan will be subject to an adjustment
determined by reference to the Group's ESG performance as set out in the table
below, as confirmed in the most recently delivered ESG Compliance Certificate (the
amount of any increase to the Margin being the "ESG Premium" and the amount
of any reduction to the Margin being the "ESG Discount"):

ESG performance for the most Senior Term Facility A Loan Margin
recently ended Ratings Period adjustment

Group Rating is 5 per cent or more The applicable Margin shall be reduced
above the National Benchmark by 0.05 per cent per annum

Group Rating is less than 5 per cent The applicable Margin shall not be
above (but 5 per cent or less below) the adjusted
National Benchmark

Group Rating is more than 5 per cent The applicable Margin shall be increased
below the National Benchmark by 0.05 per cent per annum

(b) Any change in the Margin for a Senior Term Facility A Loan pursuant to this clause
14.3 will apply from the date which is five Business Days after the date of receipt by
the Lender of the relevant ESG Compliance Certificate delivered pursuant to clause

(c) Any amount payable by the Group in respect of an ESG Premium shall be payable in
accordance with clause 14.4 (Payment of Interest).

(d) Any ESG Discount shall not be effective for any period during which an Event of
Default is continuing, provided that any applicable ESG Discount shall apply from the
date such Event of Default ceased to be continuing.

(e) A failure by the Parent to deliver an ESG Compliance Certificate in accordance with
clause 25.5 (ESG Information) shall result in there being no adjustment to the Margin
under paragraph (a) above for any Interest Period which ends between the date on
which such ESG Compliance Certificate should have been delivered in accordance
with clause 25.5 (ESG Information) and the date on which the next ESG Compliance
Certificate is delivered in accordance with clause 25.5 (ESG Information).

(f) If an ESG Discount is applicable, the Parent shall arrange for an amount equal to 50
per cent of such ESG Discount to be applied in payment to an ESG Project over the
course of the following twelve month period, and shall confirm that such payment
has been made in the ESG Compliance Certificate.

Months, on the dates falling at six Monthly intervals after the first day of the Interest
Period).

(b) If the Annual Financial Statements and related Compliance Certificate received by
the Facility Agent show that a higher or lower Margin should have applied during a
certain period, then, where a higher Margin should have applied, the Parent shall (or

to the Facility Agent any amounts necessary to put the Facility Agent and the Lenders
in the position they would have been in had the appropriate rate of the Margin applied
during such period and, where a lower Margin should have applied, the next interest
payment(s) in respect of any Facility to which a lower Margin should have applied
shall be reduced by the aggregate of the amount received by Lenders under that
Facility which were in excess of the amount they should have received had the Margin
been calculated correctly, provided that the amount of such reduction in respect of

(a) The Parent may elect, by written notice to the Facility Agent no later than 10 Business
Days prior to the end of an Interest Period in respect of a Senior Term Facility A Loan
(which Interest Period was no longer than three months), to reduce the Margin in
relation to that Loan by up to two per cent per annum (in minimum integral amounts
of one per cent per annum), provided that any such reduction in the Margin shall not
result in the Margin that is payable in cash in relation to that Loan being less than
five per cent per annum (the "PIK Toggle Option"). If the PIK Toggle Option is
exercised, then, subject to paragraph (e) below, the accrued interest on that Loan
shall be the aggregate of:

the Parent has elected to make subject to the PIK Toggle Option (such
percentage the "PIK Percentage"), which shall be paid in cash;

(ii) the PIK Percentage plus 0.25 per cent for each 1.00 per cent of PIK Percentage,
which shall be capitalised and treated as increasing the principal amount of
the relevant Loan on which it accrues; and

(iii) the applicable Term Reference Rate or Compounded Reference Rate for that
Loan, which shall be paid in cash,

in each case, on the last day of such Interest Period (and, if the Interest Period is
longer than six Months, on the dates falling at six Monthly intervals after the first
day of the Interest Period).

(b) Any valid election made pursuant to paragraph (a) above shall apply to the Interest
Period to which it relates but not for any subsequent Interest Period unless another
valid election is made for a subsequent Interest Period.

(c) The PIK Toggle Option may not be exercised in more than three consecutive Interest
Periods.

(d) All amounts of interest capitalised pursuant to paragraph (a)(ii) above, must be
repaid in full (in cash) on the Termination Date applicable to that Facility.

(e) If, on the date on which interest which would have been payable in cash in the
absence of the any valid election made pursuant to paragraph (a) above an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, the PIK Toggle Option shall not be deemed a
valid election and the applicable Margin shall be paid in full in cash on the last day
of the relevant Interest Period.

have been payable if the overdue amount had, during the period of non-payment,
constituted a Loan of the same type as the Loan in respect of which the overdue
amount has arisen or, if the unpaid amount did not arise in respect of a particular
Loan, a Senior Term Facility A Loan, in the currency of the overdue amount for

Period shall be one per cent per annum higher than the rate which would have
applied if the overdue amount had not become due.

Borrower (or the Parent) of the determination of a rate of interest relating to a Term

formalities necessary for that Borrower to obtain authorisation to make that
payment without a Tax Deduction.

(i) If a Lender has not confirmed its scheme reference number and jurisdiction of tax
residence in accordance with paragraph (g)(ii) above, no Obligor shall make a

(b) Paragraph (a) above shall not apply:

(i) with respect to any Tax assessed on a Finance Party:

(A) under the law of the jurisdiction in which that Finance Party is
incorporated or, if different, the jurisdiction (or jurisdictions) in which
that Finance Party is treated as resident for tax purposes; or

(B) under the law of the jurisdiction in which that Finance Party's Facility
Office is located, or in which that Finance Party is otherwise taxed by
reason of a permanent establishment, branch or agency, in respect of
amounts received or receivable in that jurisdiction,

to the extent that Tax is imposed on or calculated by reference to the net
income received or receivable (but not any sum deemed to be received or
receivable) by that Finance Party; or

134
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

applied; or

(D) is a liability to stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax which is dealt with

18.4 Tax Credit

(a) If an Obligor makes a Tax Payment and the relevant Finance Party (acting reasonably)
determines that a Tax Credit is attributable to an increased payment of which that
Tax Payment forms part, to that Tax Payment or to a Tax Deduction in consequence
of which that Tax Payment was required the relevant Finance Party shall use
reasonable endeavours to obtain and utilise that Tax Credit, provided that the
relevant Finance Party shall not be required to utilise the Tax Credit attributable to
an increased payment of which that Tax Payment forms part, to that Tax Payment
or to a Tax Deduction in consequence of which that Tax Payment was required in
priority to using any other Tax Credit available to the Finance Party to the extent
that to do so would jeopardise or delay the availability of any other such Tax Credit.

(b) If and when that Finance Party has obtained and utilised the Tax Credit that was
attributable to an increased payment of which that Tax Payment forms part, to that
Tax Payment or to a Tax Deduction in consequence of which that Tax Payment was
required, the Finance Party shall pay an amount to the Obligor which that Finance
Party determines will leave it (after that payment) in the same after-Tax position as
it would have been in had the Tax Payment not been required to be made by the
Obligor.

18.5 Lender status confirmation

Each Lender which is not an Original Lender shall confirm, in the documentation which it

to any Obligors, which of the following categories it falls in:

(a) not a Qualifying Lender;

(b) a Qualifying Lender (other than a Treaty Lender or an Exempt Lender); or

(c) an Exempt Lender; or

(d) a Treaty Lender.

If such a Lender fails to confirm its status in accordance with this clause 18.5 then that
Lender shall be treated for the purposes of this agreement (including by each Obligor) as if
it is not a Qualifying Lender until such time as it notifies the Facility Agent which category
applies (and the Facility Agent, upon receipt of such notification, shall inform the Parent).

135
EUS\HCB\400080815 15

that a Borrower shall pay and indemnify) each Secured Party against any cost, loss or

(a) All amounts expressed to be payable under a Finance Document by any Party to a
Finance Party which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for any supply
for VAT purposes are deemed to be exclusive of any VAT which is chargeable on that
supply, and accordingly, subject to paragraph (b) below, if VAT is or becomes
chargeable on any supply made by any Finance Party to any Party under a Finance
Document and such Finance Party is required to account to the relevant tax authority
for the VAT, that Party must pay to such Finance Party (in addition to and at the
same time as paying any other consideration for such supply) an amount equal to
the amount of the VAT (and such Finance Party must promptly provide an appropriate
VAT invoice to that Party).

(b) If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Finance Party (the
"Supplier") to any other Finance Party (the "Recipient") under a Finance
Document, and any Party other than the Recipient (the "Relevant Party") is
required by the terms of any Finance Document to pay an amount equal to the
consideration for that supply to the Supplier (rather than being required to reimburse
or indemnify the Recipient in respect of that consideration):

(i) (where the Supplier is the person required to account to the relevant tax
authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must also pay to the Supplier (at
the same time as paying that amount) an additional amount equal to the
amount of the VAT. The Recipient must (where this paragraph (i) applies)
promptly pay to the Relevant Party an amount equal to any credit or
repayment the Recipient receives from the relevant tax authority which the
Recipient reasonably determines relates to the VAT chargeable on that supply;
and

(ii) (where the Recipient is the person required to account to the relevant tax
authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must promptly, following demand
from the Recipient, pay to the Recipient an amount equal to the VAT
chargeable on that supply but only to the extent that the Recipient reasonably
determines that it is not entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant tax
authority in respect of that VAT.

(c) Where a Finance Document requires any Party to reimburse or indemnify a Finance
Party for any cost or expense, that Party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case
may be) such Finance Party for the full amount of such cost or expense, including
such part thereof as represents VAT, save to the extent that such Finance Party
reasonably determines that it is entitled to credit or repayment in respect of such
VAT from the relevant tax authority.

136

-----

(d) Any reference in this clause 18.7 to any Party shall, at any time when such Party is
treated as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and
unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to the representative member of
such group at such time (the term "representative member" to have the same
meaning as in the Value Added Tax Act 1994).

(e) In relation to any supply made by a Finance Party to any Party under a Finance
Document, if reasonably requested by such Finance Party, that Party must promptly
provide such Finance Party with details of that Party's VAT registration and such
other information as is reasonably requested in connection with such Finance Party's
VAT reporting requirements in relation to such supply.

18.8 FATCA information

(a) Subject to paragraph (c) below, each Party shall, within ten Business Days of a
reasonable request by another Party:

(i) confirm to that other Party whether it is:

(A) a FATCA Exempt Party; or

(B) not a FATCA Exempt Party;

(ii) supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other information
relating to its status under FATCA as that other Party reasonably requests for
the purposes of that other Party's compliance with FATCA; and

(iii) supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other information
relating to its status as that other Party reasonably requests for the purposes
of that other Party's compliance with any other law, regulation, or exchange
of information regime.

(b) If a Party confirms to another Party pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) above that it is a
FATCA Exempt Party and it subsequently becomes aware that it is not or has ceased
to be a FATCA Exempt Party, that Party shall notify that other Party reasonably
promptly.

(c) Paragraph (a) above shall not oblige any Finance Party to do anything, and paragraph
(a)(iii) above shall not oblige any other Party to do anything, which would or might
in its reasonable opinion constitute a breach of:

(i) any law or regulation;

(ii) any fiduciary duty; or

(iii) any duty of confidentiality.

(d) If a Party fails to confirm whether or not it is a FATCA Exempt Party or to supply
forms, documentation or other information requested in accordance with paragraph
(a)(i) or (a)(ii) above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, where paragraph (c)
above applies), then such Party shall be treated for the purposes of the Finance
Documents (and payments under them) as if it is not a FATCA Exempt Party until
such time as the Party in question provides the requested confirmation, forms,
documentation or other information.

18.9 FATCA Deduction

(a) Each Party may make any FATCA Deduction it is required to make by FATCA, and
any payment required in connection with that FATCA Deduction, and no Party shall

-----

be required to increase any payment in respect of which it makes such a FATCA
Deduction or otherwise compensate the recipient of the payment for that FATCA
Deduction.

(b) Each Party shall promptly, upon becoming aware that it must make a FATCA
Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of such FATCA
Deduction), notify the Party to whom it is making the payment and, in addition, shall
notify the Parent and the Facility Agent and the Facility Agent shall notify the other
Finance Parties.

it or any Finance Party) including:

to the benefit of the same; and

26.3 Financial testing

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, the financial covenants set out in clause 26.2
(Financial condition)shall be calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles
used in the Base Case Model (with such amendments as are agreed with the Majority
Lenders and the Majority Super Senior Facility Lenders) and tested by reference to
each of the financial statements delivered pursuant to paragraphs (a)(i) and (b) of
clause 25.1 (Financial statements) and/or each Compliance Certificate delivered
pursuant to clause 25.2 (Provision and contents of Compliance Certificate).

(b) So long as any cost savings or cost synergies included as Permitted Synergies are
projected as being realisable at any time during the Relevant Period, it may be
assumed that such cost savings or cost synergies will be realisable during the entire
such period, provided that any such pro forma increase to EBITDA shall be without
duplication for cost savings or cost synergies actually realised during such period and
already included in EBITDA.

(c) Any component of EBITDA denominated in a currency other than the Base Currency
shall be converted into the Base Currency for the purpose of calculating EBITDA on
the basis of the exchange rate used in the relevant financial statements (consistently
applied) and any Borrowings denominated in a currency other than the Base
Currency shall be converted into the Base Currency for the purpose of calculating
Total Net Debt on the basis of:

(i) where a member of the Group has entered into a foreign exchange rate
hedging arrangement in respect of any Financial Indebtedness, the relevant
fixed exchange rate under such hedging arrangement to the extent of the
amount of Financial Indebtedness which is so hedged; or

(ii) in respect of other Financial Indebtedness, the weighted average exchange
rates used in determining EBITDA for the Relevant Period in the relevant
financial statements (consistently applied).

(d) For the purpose of the financial covenants set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause
26.2 (Financial condition) (and any other calculation of Adjusted Leverage under this
agreement) for each of the Relevant Periods ending on a date which is less than 12
months after the Closing Date, EBITDA shall be calculated by reference to the period
of 12 months ending on the last day of such Relevant Period (and, where such 12
month period includes a period before the Closing Date, EBITDA shall be determined
by reference to the Target Group before such date).

26.4 Equity Cure

(a) Subject to paragraphs (b) to (e) below, if an Event of Default or Material Event of
Default occurs or the Parent is concerned that it would otherwise occur under clause
28.2 (Financial covenants and other obligations) in respect of a breach of paragraphs
(a) and/or (b) of clause 26.2 (Financial condition) (each a "Curable Default"), no
Event of Default or Material Event of Default will occur if:

(i) by no later than the date falling ten Business Days after the earlier of the date
of the Compliance Certificate evidencing the Curable Default and the date
upon which such Compliance Certificate should have been delivered under
clause 25 (Information undertakings), the Parent has notified the Facility
Agent that it intends to effect a cure pursuant to this clause; and

175
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

(ii) by no later than the date falling 25 Business Days after the earlier of the date
of the Compliance Certificate evidencing the Curable Default and the date
upon which such Compliance Certificate should have been delivered under
clause 25 (Information undertakings), the Company has received the
proceeds of a New Shareholder Injection to be applied under this clause 26.4
which are of a sufficient amount to remedy the Curable Default (the amount
of such received funds being the "Equity Cure Amount") in accordance with
paragraph (b) below.

(b) Once the Equity Cure Amount has been received by the Company the financial
covenants set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 26.2 (Financial condition) shall
be retested, at the Parent's election by either:

(i) deeming Borrowings under the Facilities to be decreased by such Equity Cure
Amount (pro rata across the Facilities) as of the first day of the Relevant
Period in which the Curable Default occurred, or the Parent anticipated it
would have occurred if this clause was not invoked, and, if and only to the
extent that the Equity Cure Amount remains on the Group's balance sheet as
Cash or is invested as a Cash Equivalent Investment, the next three Relevant
Periods; or

(ii) subject to paragraph (e)(viii) below, once during the life of the Facilities only,
deeming EBITDA to be increased by an amount equal to (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, no greater than) the amount required to cure the Curable
Default (such amount being, the "Minimum Equity Cure Amount") as of
the first day of the Relevant Period in which the Curable Default occurred, or
the Parent anticipated it would have occurred if this clause was not invoked,
and the next three Relevant Periods.

(c) If, after Borrowings are deemed decreased, or (as applicable) EBITDA is increased
under paragraph (b) above, the financial covenants are complied with, the Parent
shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of the financial covenants as of
the relevant testing dates with the same effect as if there had been no breach of
those financial covenants and, if applicable, that Curable Default shall be deemed
remedied for all purposes under the Finance Documents.

(d) The Group may only exercise its rights under paragraph (a) above:

(i) four times before the Termination Date of the Super Senior Term Facility; and

(ii) (without prejudice to the deemed application of an Equity Cure Amount in
respect of three further Relevant Periods referred to in paragraph (b) above
in respect of any Curable Default pursuant to paragraphs (a) and/or (b) of
clause 26.2 (Financial condition)) not in respect of two consecutive Relevant
Periods.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt:

(i) if within 25 Business Days of the earlier of the date of the Compliance
Certificate evidencing the Curable Default or the date upon which such
Compliance Certificate should have been delivered under clause 25
(Information undertakings), the Company has not received sufficient of the
funds referred to in paragraph (a) above to remedy the relevant Curable
Default in accordance with this clause 26.4, the Finance Parties will be
permitted to take any action available to them specified in clause 28.18
(Acceleration) or clause 28.19 (Super Senior Acceleration), as applicable,
immediately upon the expiry of that period;

176
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

(ii) this clause 26.4 shall not restrict the ability of any Finance Party to take action
under clause 28.18 (Acceleration) in respect of any other Event of Default, or
under clause 28.19 (Super Senior Acceleration) in respect of any other
Material Event of Default, in each case which is not a Curable Default being
remedied in accordance with paragraph (a) above;

(iii) any Equity Cure Amount shall be applied as contemplated by paragraph (b)
above even if the Parent may have complied with one or more of the financial
covenants in clause 26.2 (Financial condition) in the absence of such
application, provided that:

(A) such Equity Cure Amount applied in respect of any Curable Default
pursuant to paragraph (a) of clause 26.2 (Financial condition) shall be
applied in the same way in respect of paragraph (b) of clause 26.2
(Financial condition);

(B) its application in respect of paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 26.2
(Financial condition) shall count only as one exercise of its rights under
paragraph (a) above; and

(C) where the Parent has elected to apply the Minimum Equity Cure
Amount as contemplated by paragraph (b)(ii) above, its application in
respect of paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 26.2 (Financial condition)
shall count only as one exercise of its rights under paragraph (b)(ii)
above;

(iv) save as contemplated in paragraph (vi) below, no part of the Equity Cure
Amount shall be required to be applied in prepayment of the Facilities;

(v) where the Parent has elected to apply the Equity Cure Amount as
contemplated by paragraph (b)(i) above, there shall be no limit on the amount
of the Equity Cure Amount;

(vi) where the Parent has elected to apply the Minimum Equity Cure Amount as
contemplated by paragraph (b)(ii) above but the relevant Equity Cure Amount
is greater than the Minimum Equity Cure Amount, EBITDA shall only be
increased by an amount equal to the Minimum Equity Cure Amount, and the
difference between the Equity Cure Amount and the Minimum Equity Cure
Amount shall be deemed to reduce Borrowings in accordance with paragraph
(b)(i) above;

(vii) any recalculation of the financial covenants in paragraphs (a) or (b) of clause
26.2 (Financial condition) made under this clause 26.4 will be solely for the
purpose of curing a relevant breach of that paragraph and not for any other
purpose, including (without limitation) the calculation of Margin, in the
definitions of Permitted Payment or Permitted Acquisition, the calculation of
the Listing Proceeds to be applied in mandatory prepayment of the Facility in
clause 11 (Mandatory prepayment and cancellation), any Utilisation of the
Incremental Term Facility;

(viii) there shall be no double counting under this clause 26.4 in respect of any

condition) in respect of a Relevant Period (the "First Period") but the Parent is in
compliance with all its obligations under clause 26.2 (Financial condition) in respect

applications of clause 26.4 (Equity Cure) to that Second Period) and the Facility
Agent (acting on behalf of the Lenders or the Super Senior Facility Lenders, as
applicable) has not exercised any of the rights set out in clause 28.18 (Acceleration)
or clause 28.19 (Super Senior Acceleration), then the breach of such obligations in

(Financial condition).

to in paragraph (a) above shall be a breach of clause 26.2 (Financial condition) until

the Parent and the Investors shall have the right to match the terms and
economics of such assignment, transfer or sub-participation (such right, a
"Right to Match") provided that the Parent or the Investors advise the
relevant lender of their intention to exercise the Right to Match no later than
two Business Days prior to the proposed date of the relevant assignment,

established for the purpose of making, purchasing or investing in loans,
securities or other financial assets (as agreed with the Facility Agent, each
acting in good faith) to the Pre-Approved New Lender List in place of each
person removed; and

(iii) remove an entity (a "Potential Transferee") from the Pre-Approved New
Lender List where such Potential Transferee has been acquired by, has merged

administered by persons operating behind appropriate information barriers
implemented or maintained as required by law, regulation or internal policy

is independent from that of the Potential Transferee and any information
provided under the Finance Documents is not (or is not capable of being)

List if such entity has become a Loan to Own Investor, Competitor, Sponsor
Competitor or Defaulting Lender.

clause 29.2 (Parent consent) shall be automatically added to the Pre-Approved New

29.4 Other conditions of assignment or transfer

(a) An assignment, transfer or sub-participation in respect of the Revolving Facility or
the Revolving Facility Commitments, shall not be made without the prior consent of
the Parent (which may be withheld or conditioned in the Parent's absolute discretion)
unless the relevant assignee, transferee or sub-participant is a deposit taking
financial institution authorised by a financial services regulator or similar regulatory
body which has a long term credit rating equal to or better than BBB- or Baa2 (as
applicable) according to at least two of Standard & Poor's Rating Services, Fitch
Ratings Ltd. or Moody's Investors Service Limited.

(b) An assignment or transfer of part (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, the whole) of
a Lender's participation must be in an amount such that the Base Currency Amount
of that Lender's remaining participation (when aggregated with its Affiliates' and
Related Funds' participation) in respect of Commitments or Loans made under the
Term Facilities (taken together) is in a minimum amount of Â£2,000,000, unless that
assignment or transfer is made at a time when a Relevant Event of Default is
continuing.

(c) (Other than in the case of an assignment permitted by paragraph (b) of clause 30.1
(Permitted Debt Purchase Transactions)) an assignment will only be effective on:

(i) receipt by the Facility Agent (whether in the Assignment Agreement or
otherwise) of written confirmation from the New Lender (in form and
substance satisfactory to the Facility Agent) that the New Lender will assume
the same obligations to the other Finance Parties and the other Secured
Parties as it would have been under if it had been an Original Lender;

(ii) if not already party to the Intercreditor Agreement in the relevant capacity,
the New Lender entering into the documentation required for it to accede as
a party to the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(iii) performance by the Facility Agent of all necessary "know your customer" or
other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations in relation to
such assignment to a New Lender, the completion of which the Facility Agent
shall promptly notify to the Existing Lender and the New Lender.

(d) A transfer will only be effective if the New Lender enters into the documentation
required for it to accede as a party to the Intercreditor Agreement (if not already
party to the Intercreditor Agreement in the relevant capacity) and if the procedure
set out in clause 29.9 (Procedure for transfer) is complied with.

(e) If:

(i) a Lender assigns or transfers any of its rights or obligations under the Finance
Documents or changes its Facility Office; and

(ii) as a result of circumstances existing at the date the assignment, transfer or
change occurs, an Obligor would be obliged to make a payment to the New
Lender or Lender acting through its new Facility Office under clauses 18 (Tax
gross up and indemnities) or 19 (Increased Costs),

then the New Lender or Lender acting through its new Facility Office is only entitled
to receive payment under those clauses to the same extent as the Existing Lender
or Lender acting through its previous Facility Office would have been if the
assignment, transfer or change had not occurred provided that this paragraph (e)
shall not apply in relation to clause 18.2 (Tax gross-up) to a Treaty Lender that has
included a confirmation of its HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme reference number
and jurisdiction of tax residence in accordance with paragraph (g)(ii) of clause 18.2

204
EUS\HCB\400080815 15

Filing in respect of that Treaty Lender, unless the relevant payment falls due within
10 Business Days of the transfer, assignment or change occurring.

(f) Each New Lender, by executing the relevant Transfer Certificate or Assignment
Agreement, confirms, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Facility Agent has
authority to execute on its behalf any amendment or waiver that has been approved
by or on behalf of the requisite Lender or Lenders in accordance with this agreement
on or prior to the date on which the transfer or assignment becomes effective in
accordance with this agreement and that it is bound by that decision to the same
extent as the Existing Lender would have been had it remained a Lender.

29.5 Sub-participations

(a) An Existing Lender may, subject to this clause 29.5, enter into a sub-participation
(whether funded or unfunded), sub-contract or similar arrangements (each a
"Participation Agreement") in respect of its rights and obligations under this
agreement provided that the Lender remains liable under this agreement in relation
to those rights and obligations or, to the extent any voting rights are transferred or
are capable of being transferred by the Lender, paragraph (b) below is complied with.

(b) Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, the prior written consent of the Parent is
required to any Participation Agreement pursuant to the terms of which any voting
rights of a Lender are transferred or are capable of being transferred to the respective
counterparty of the Participation Agreement unless:

(i) the counterparty to the Participation Agreement is:

(A) an entity identified on the Pre-Approved New Lender List;

(B) another Lender or an Affiliate of any Lender;

(C) a fund which is a Related Fund of that Existing Lender; or

(ii) the Participation Agreement is entered into at a time when a Relevant Event

avoidance of doubt, never deemed given) unless such assignment or transfer is made
pursuant to paragraph (b)(i)(B) or (b)(i)(C) above.

Notwithstanding the above, no Participation Agreement may be entered into at any
time if the counterparty to that Participation Agreement is a Loan to Own Investor,
Competitor, competitor of the Sponsor or Defaulting Lender at any time.

205
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

(d) A request to the Parent for consent or (applicable) notice of sub-participation under

Sponsor to any sub-participation by an Existing Lender.

29.6 Transfer in breach of criteria â disenfranchisement

If a Lender transfers or assigns all or part of its Commitment (the "Transferred
Commitment") or enters into a Participation Agreement in respect of all or part of its
Commitment (the "Sub-participated Commitment") in breach of any requirement
contained in clause 29.2 (Parent consent), clause 29.4 (Other conditions of assignment or
transfer) or clause 29.5 (Sub-participations) (such transferee, assignee or counterparty to
the Participation Agreement (as applicable) being, in respect of the Transferred
Commitment, a "Disqualified Transferee"), as the case may be, then until and unless
the subsequent written consent of the Parent to the relevant transfer or assignment or
Participation Agreement is obtained (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed (provided that it shall be reasonable for the Parent to withhold consent in the
circumstances referred to in paragraph (b) of clause 29.2 (Parent consent) or paragraph (c)
of clause 29.5 (Sub-participations))) or deemed to be given:

or other vote under the Finance Documents the Transferred Commitment or
the Sub-participated Commitment shall be deemed to be zero; and

(b) the Disqualified Transferee shall:

(i) in relation to any meeting or conference call to which all the Lenders are
invited to attend or participate, not attend or participate in the same or be
entitled to receive the agenda or any minutes of the same;

delivered in accordance with this agreement or prepared at the request of, or
on the instructions of, the Facility Agent or one or more of the Lenders; and

relied exclusively on any information provided to it by the Existing Lender or
any other Finance Party in connection with any Transaction Document or the
Transaction Security; and

(ii) will continue to make its own independent appraisal of the creditworthiness
of each Obligor and its related entities whilst any amount is or may be
outstanding under the Finance Documents or any Commitment is in force.

(c) Nothing in any Finance Document obliges an Existing Lender to:

(i) accept a re-transfer or re-assignment from a New Lender of any of the rights
and obligations assigned or transferred under this clause 29; or

(ii) support any losses directly or indirectly incurred by the New Lender by reason
of the non-performance by any Obligor of its obligations under the Transaction
Documents or otherwise.

29.9 Procedure for transfer

member of the Group and the New Lender have assumed and/or acquired the
same in place of that Obligor and the Existing Lender;

(iii) the Facility Agent, the Arranger, the Security Agent, the New Lender, the
other Lenders and any relevant Ancillary Lender shall acquire the same rights
and assume the same obligations between themselves and in respect of the
Transaction Security as they would have acquired and assumed had the New
Lender been an Original Lender with the rights, and/or obligations acquired
or assumed by it as a result of the transfer and to that extent the Facility
Agent, the Arranger, the Security Agent and any relevant Ancillary Lender and
the Existing Lender shall each be released from further obligations to each
other under the Finance Documents; and

obligations equivalent to the Relevant Obligations.

(d) Lenders may utilise procedures other than those set out in this clause 29.10 to assign

208
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

relevant Obligor or unless in accordance with clause 29.9 (Procedure for transfer),
to obtain a release by that Obligor from the obligations owed to that Obligor by the

(a) any charge, assignment or other Security to secure obligations to a federal reserve
or central bank; and

substitute the beneficiary of the relevant charge, assignment or Security for
the Lender as a party to any of the Finance Documents; or

(ii) require any payments to be made by an Obligor other than or in excess of, or
grant to any person any more extensive rights than, those required to be
made or granted to the relevant Lender under the Finance Documents.

29.14 Pro rata interest settlement

current Interest Period (or, if the Interest Period is longer than six Months, on
the next of the dates which falls at six Monthly intervals after the first day of
that Interest Period); and

(ii) the rights assigned or transferred by the Existing Lender will not include the

(A) when the Accrued Amounts become payable, those Accrued Amounts
will be payable for the account of the Existing Lender; and

(B) the amount payable to the New Lender on that date will be the amount
which would, but for the application of this clause 29.14, have been
payable to it on that date, but after deduction of the Accrued Amounts.

(b) In this clause 29.14 references to "Interest Period" shall be construed to include
a reference to any other period for accrual of fees.

(c) An Existing Lender which retains the right to the Accrued Amounts pursuant to this
clause 29.14 but which does not have a Commitment shall be deemed not to be a
Lender for the purposes of ascertaining whether the agreement of any specified

Process shall be completed and settled on or before the fifth Business Day

lowest price being accepted first) and that if in respect of participations in a
particular Term Facility it receives two or more offers at the same price it shall

participating in the relevant Term Facilities of the same. Any Lender wishing
to sell pursuant to an Open Order will, by 11.00 a.m. on any Business Day
following the date on which the Open Order is placed but no earlier than the

Lender to sell under the relevant Open Order.

(viii) If in respect of participations in a Term Facility the Purchase Agent receives
on the same Business Day two or more offers at the set price such that the

211
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

maximum amount of such Term Facility to which an Open Order relates would
be exceeded, the Parent shall only accept such offers on a pro rata basis.

(d) The Parent shall, by 5.00 p.m. on the sixth Business Day following the date on which
an Open Order is placed, notify the Facility Agent of the amounts of the participations
purchased through such Open Order Process and the identity of the Term Facilities

the Lenders.

(a) For so long as a Sponsor Affiliate:

(i) beneficially owns a Commitment; or

other agreement or arrangement having a substantially similar economic
effect and such agreement or arrangement has not been terminated,

in ascertaining:

(A) the Majority Lenders, the Incremental Term Facility Majority Lenders,

-----

(bb) the agreement of any specified group of Lenders,

has been obtained to approve any request for a consent, waiver,
amendment or other vote under the Finance Documents such
Commitment shall be deemed to be zero and such Sponsor Affiliate or
the person with whom it has entered into such sub-participation, other
agreement or arrangement shall be deemed not to be a Lender for the
purposes of paragraphs (A) and (B) above (unless in the case of a
person not being a Sponsor Affiliate it is a Lender by virtue otherwise
than by beneficially owning the relevant Commitment) other than any
vote which is an Entrenched Vote.

connection with any request for a consent, waiver, amendment or other vote under
the Finance Documents which:

(i) relates to an increase in Commitments of that Sponsor Affiliate;

(ii) would result in any Commitment of that Sponsor Affiliate under a particular
Facility being treated in any manner which is inconsistent with the treatment
proposed to be applied to any other Commitment under such Facility; or

(iii) would adversely affect the rights and/or obligations of that Sponsor Affiliate,
solely in its capacity as a Finance Party (and for the avoidance of doubt,
excluding its interests as a holder of equity in the Parent (whether directly or
indirectly)) disproportionately to the other Finance Parties.

(c) Each Lender shall, unless such Debt Purchase Transaction is an assignment or
transfer, promptly notify the Facility Agent in writing if it knowingly enters into a
Debt Purchase Transaction with a Sponsor Affiliate or Borrower (a "Notifiable Debt
Purchase Transaction"), such notification to be substantially in the form set out in
part 1 of schedule 13 (Forms of Notifiable Debt Purchase Transaction Notice).

(d) A Lender shall promptly notify the Facility Agent if a Notifiable Debt Purchase
Transaction to which it is a party:

(i) is terminated; or

(ii) ceases to be with a Sponsor Affiliate or Borrower,

such notification to be substantially in the form set out in part 2 of schedule 13
(Forms of Notifiable Debt Purchase Transaction Notice).

(e) Each Sponsor Affiliate or Borrower that is a Lender agrees that:

(i) in relation to any meeting or conference call to which all the Lenders are
invited to attend or participate, it shall not attend or participate in the same
or, be entitled to receive the agenda or any minutes of the same, unless in
either case, the Facility Agent otherwise agrees; and

(ii) in its capacity as Lender, unless the Facility Agent otherwise agrees, it shall
not be entitled to receive any report or other document prepared at the behest
of, or on the instructions of, the Facility Agent or one or more of the Lenders.

30.3 Sponsor Affiliates' or Borrower's notification to other Lenders of Debt Purchase

(a) where that Borrower or Guarantor created Transaction Security over any of its assets
or business in favour of the Security Agent, or Transaction Security in favour of the
Security Agent was created over the shares (or equivalent) of that Borrower or
Guarantor, the Security Agent shall, at the cost and request of the Parent, release
those assets, business or shares (or equivalent) and (where requested to do so by
the Parent) issue certificates of non-crystallisation; and

may appoint a successor Facility Agent (acting through an office in the United
Kingdom).

with paragraph (b) above within 20 days after notice of resignation was given, the

Agent may (if it concludes (acting reasonably) that it is necessary to do so in order
to persuade the proposed successor Facility Agent to become a party to this
agreement as Facility Agent) agree with the proposed successor Facility Agent
amendments to this clause 32.12 and any other term of this agreement dealing with
the rights or obligations of the Facility Agent consistent with then current market
practice for the appointment and protection of corporate trustees and those
amendments will bind the Parties.

Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after
that FATCA Application Date;

information) indicates that the Facility Agent will not be (or will have ceased
to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA Application Date; or

will not be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that
FATCA Application Date;

required to make a FATCA Deduction that would not be required if the Facility Agent
were a FATCA Exempt Party, and the Parent or that Lender, by notice to the Facility
Agent, requires it to resign.

32.13 Replacement of the Facility Agent

(a) After consultation with the Parent, the Majority Lenders may, by giving 30 days'

Agent by appointing a successor Facility Agent (acting through an office in the United
Kingdom).

Facility Agent may reasonably request for the purposes of performing its functions

Facility Agent) and this clause 32 (and any agency fees for the account of the retiring
Facility Agent shall cease to accrue from (and shall be payable on) that date).

shall not be deemed to have notice of it.

the person shown in its records as Lender at the opening of business (in the place of
the Facility Agent's principal office as notified to the Finance Parties from time to
time) as the Lender acting through its Facility Office:

a notification of a substitute address, fax number, electronic mail address (or such
other information), department and officer by that Lender for the purposes of
clause 37.2 (Addresses) and paragraph (a)(i) of clause 37.6 (Electronic

(ii) the Facility Agent shall determine whether the receipt or recovery is in excess
of the amount the Recovering Finance Party would have been paid had the
receipt or recovery been received or made by the Facility Agent and
distributed in accordance with clause 35 (Payment mechanics), without taking
account of any Tax which would be imposed on the Facility Agent in relation
to the receipt, recovery or distribution; and

(iii) the Recovering Finance Party shall, within three Business Days of demand by
the Facility Agent, pay to the Facility Agent an amount (the "Sharing
Payment") equal to such receipt or recovery less any amount which the
Facility Agent determines may be retained by the Recovering Finance Party
as its share of any payment to be made, in accordance with clause 35.6

227
EUS\HCB\400080815 15

Ancillary Lender in respect of any cash cover provided for the benefit of that Ancillary

Obligor and distribute it between the Finance Parties (other than the Recovering Finance
Party) (the "Sharing Finance Parties") in accordance with clause 35.6 (Partial payments)
towards the obligations of that Obligor to the Sharing Finance Parties.

34.3 Recovering Finance Party's rights

On a distribution by the Facility Agent under clause 34.2 (Redistribution of payments) of a
payment received by a Recovering Finance Party from an Obligor, as between the relevant

the Sharing Payment will be treated as not having been paid by that Obligor.

34.4 Reversal of redistribution

If any part of the Sharing Payment received or recovered by a Recovering Finance Party
becomes repayable and is repaid by that Recovering Finance Party, then:

(a) each Sharing Finance Party shall, upon request of the Facility Agent, pay to the
Facility Agent for the account of that Recovering Finance Party an amount equal to
the appropriate part of its share of the Sharing Payment (together with an amount
as is necessary to reimburse that Recovering Finance Party for its proportion of any
interest on the Sharing Payment which that Recovering Finance Party is required to
pay) (the "Redistributed Amount"); and

(b) as between the relevant Obligor and each relevant Sharing Finance Party, an amount
equal to the relevant Redistributed Amount will be treated as not having been paid
by that Obligor.

not, after making any payment pursuant to this clause 34, have a valid and
enforceable claim against the relevant Obligor.

(b) A Recovering Finance Party is not obliged to share with any other Finance Party any
amount which the Recovering Finance Party has received or recovered as a result of
taking legal or arbitration proceedings, if:

(i) it notified the other Finance Party of the legal or arbitration proceedings; and

35.1 Payments to the Facility Agent

(a) On each date on which an Obligor or a Lender is required to make a payment under
a Finance Document, excluding a payment under the terms of an Ancillary Document,
that Obligor or Lender shall make the same available to the Facility Agent (unless a
contrary indication appears in a Finance Document) for value on the due date at the
time and in such funds specified by the Facility Agent as being customary at the time
for settlement of transactions in the relevant currency in the place of payment.

(b) Payment shall be made to such account in the principal financial centre of the country
of that currency (or, in relation to euro, in a principal financial centre in such
Participating Member State or London, as specified by the Facility Agent) and with
such bank as the Facility Agent, in each case, specifies.

35.2 Distributions by the Facility Agent

Each payment received by the Facility Agent under the Finance Documents for another Party
shall, subject to clause 35.3 (Distributions to an Obligor) and clause 35.4 (Clawback and
pre-funding) be made available by the Facility Agent as soon as reasonably practicable after
receipt to the Party entitled to receive payment in accordance with this agreement (in the
case of a Lender, for the account of its Facility Office), to such account as that Party may
notify to the Facility Agent by not less than five Business Days' notice, or in the case of a
Borrower, such shorter period as is contemplated by clause 5.1 (Delivery of a Utilisation
Request), with a bank specified by that Party in the principal financial centre of the country
of that currency (or, in relation to euro, in the principal financial centre of a Participating
Member State or London, as specified by that Party) or, in the case of a Borrower, to such
account as it may notify to the Facility Agent in accordance with clause 5.1 (Delivery of a
Utilisation Request).

35.3 Distributions to an Obligor

The Facility Agent may (with the consent of the Obligor or in accordance with clause 36

the Finance Documents or in or towards purchase of any amount of any currency to be so
applied.

establish to its satisfaction that it has actually received that sum.

(b) Unless paragraph (c) below applies, if the Facility Agent pays an amount to another
Party and it proves to be the case that the Facility Agent had not actually received
that amount, then the Party to whom that amount (or the proceeds of any related
exchange contract) was paid by the Facility Agent shall on demand refund the same
to the Facility Agent together with interest on that amount from the date of payment
to the date of receipt by the Facility Agent, calculated by the Facility Agent to reflect
its cost of funds.

-----

(c) If the Facility Agent has notified the Lenders that it is willing to make available
amounts for the account of a Borrower before receiving funds from the Lenders then
if and to the extent that the Facility Agent does so but it proves to be the case that
it does not then receive funds from a Lender in respect of a sum which it paid to a
Borrower:

(i) the Facility Agent shall notify the Parent of that Lender's identity and the
Borrower to whom that sum was made available shall on demand refund it to
the Facility Agent; and

(ii) the Lender by whom those funds should have been made available or, if that
Lender fails to do so, the Borrower to whom that sum was made available,

Facility Agent) which will indemnify the Facility Agent against any funding cost
incurred by it as a result of paying out that sum before receiving those funds
from that Lender.

35.5 Impaired Agent

(a) If, at any time, the Facility Agent becomes an Impaired Agent, an Obligor or a Lender
which is required to make a payment under the Finance Documents to the Facility
Agent in accordance with clause 35.1 (Payments to the Facility Agent) may instead
either:

(i) pay that amount direct to the required recipient(s); or

(ii) if in its absolute discretion it considers that it is not reasonably practicable to
pay that amount direct to the required recipient(s), pay that amount or the
relevant part of that amount to an interest-bearing account held with an
Acceptable Bank within the meaning of paragraph (a) of the definition of
"Acceptable Bank" and in relation to which no Insolvency Event has occurred
and is continuing, in the name of the Obligor or the Lender making the
payment (the "Paying Party") and designated as a trust account for the
benefit of the Party or Parties beneficially entitled to that payment under the
Finance Documents (the "Recipient Party" or "Recipient Parties").

In each case such payments must be made on the due date for payment under the
Finance Documents.

(b) All interest accrued on the amount standing to the credit of the trust account shall
be for the benefit of the Recipient Party or the Recipient Parties pro rata to their
respective entitlements.

clause 32.13 (Replacement of the Facility Agent), each Paying Party shall (other than
to the extent that that Party has given an instruction pursuant to paragraph (e)
below) give all requisite instructions to the bank with whom the trust account is held
to transfer the amount (together with any accrued interest) to the successor Facility
Agent for distribution to the relevant Recipient Party or Recipient Parties in
accordance with clause 35.2 (Distributions by the Facility Agent).

(e) A Paying Party shall, promptly upon request by a Recipient Party and to the extent:

Party.

respect of any Finance Documents that is insufficient to discharge all the amounts
then due and payable by an Obligor under those Finance Documents, the Facility
Agent shall apply that payment towards the obligations of that Obligor under the
Finance Documents in the following order:

Facility Agent or the Security Agent under the Finance Documents;

(ii) secondly, in or towards payment pro rata of any accrued interest, fee or
commission due but unpaid under those Finance Documents;

is not a Business Day shall be made on the next Business Day in the same calendar
month (if there is one) or the preceding Business Day (if there is not).

under this agreement interest is payable on the principal or Unpaid Sum at the rate

currency.

administration of the Facilities as the Facility Agent may deem necessary in the
circumstances;

1.1 In determining what security or guarantees ("Security") will be provided in support of the
Facilities the following matters will be taken into account. Security shall not be created or
perfected to the extent that it would:

(a) result in any breach of corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference
or thin capitalisation laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable
jurisdiction;

(b) result in a significant risk to any directors or officers of the relevant grantor of
Security or contravention of their fiduciary duties and/or of civil or criminal or
personal liability;

(c) interfere unreasonably with the ordinary course of operations of the grantor of the
Security; or

(d) result in costs that are unreasonable in all the circumstances or disproportionate to
the benefit obtained by the beneficiaries of that Security.

1.2 For the avoidance of doubt, in these Agreed Security Principles, "cost" includes, but is not
limited to, income tax cost, registration taxes payable on the creation or enforcement or for
the continuance of any Security, stamp duties, notarisation fees, legal fees, out-of-pocket
expenses, and other fees and expenses directly incurred by the relevant grantor of Security
or any of its direct or indirect owners, subsidiaries or Affiliates.

2. OBLIGATIONS TO BE SECURED

2.1 Subject to paragraph 1 (Considerations) above and sub-paragraph 2.3 below, the
obligations to be secured are the Secured Obligations (as defined below). The Transaction
Security is to be granted in favour of the Security Agent on behalf of each Lender from time
to time, and the Facility Agent, the Arranger and any Hedge Counterparty.

2.2 For ease of reference, the following definitions should, to the extent legally possible, be
incorporated into each Transaction Security Document (with the capitalised terms used in
them having the meaning given to them in the Intercreditor Agreement):

"Secured Obligations" means all the Liabilities and all other present and future liabilities
and obligations at any time due, owing or incurred by any member of the Group and by
each Debtor to any Secured Party under the Debt Documents, both actual and contingent
and whether incurred solely or jointly and as principal or surety or in any other capacity;
and

"Secured Parties" means the Security Agent, any Receiver or Delegate and each of the
Primary Creditors from time to time but, in the case of each Primary Creditor, only if it is a
party to the Intercreditor Agreement or has acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement, in the
appropriate capacity, pursuant to clause 21.11 (Creditor Accession Undertaking) of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

2.3 The obligations guaranteed and/or secured by any Obligor will be limited:

(a) to avoid any breach of corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference,
thin capitalisation rules or the laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any
applicable jurisdiction; and

21
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

(b) to avoid any risk to officers or directors of the relevant member of the Group that is
granting Security of contravention of their fiduciary duties and/or civil or criminal or
personal liability.

3. GENERAL

3.1 Where appropriate, defined terms in the Transaction Security Documents should mirror
those in this agreement.

3.2 The parties to this agreement agree to negotiate the form of each Transaction Security
Document in good faith and will ensure that all documentation required to be entered into
as a condition precedent to first drawdown or subsequent under this agreement is in a finally
agreed form as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this agreement.

3.3 The first draft of each Transaction Security Document prepared by the Secured Parties'
counsel shall reflect these Agreed Security Principles.

3.4 The form of guarantee is set out in clause 23 (Guarantee and indemnity) of this agreement
and, with respect to any Additional Guarantor, is subject to any limitations set out in the
Accession Deed applicable to such Additional Guarantor.

3.5 The Security shall, to the extent possible under local law, be enforceable following the
occurrence of a Declared Default.

3.6 It shall not be necessary for an Excluded Entity to become an Additional Guarantor or grant
Transaction Security.

3.7 To the extent that Transaction Security is granted over the issued share capital of CareTech
International Limited, it shall not be necessary for CareTech International Limited to grant
Transaction Security over the issued share capital of any of its Subsidiaries that are
Excluded Entities.

3.8 For the purposes of this schedule:

"Excluded Entity" means any member of the Group that is incorporated in an Excluded
Jurisdiction; and

"Excluded Jurisdiction" means the United Arab Emirates.

4. SHARES

4.1 Any share security will provide that, until a notice has been served by the Facility Agent in
accordance with clause 28.18 (Acceleration) or clause 28.19 (Super Senior Acceleration),
the grantor of the Security will be entitled to:

(a) receive dividends unless the payment of those dividends is otherwise prohibited by
this agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(b) exercise voting rights, unless the exercise of those rights is reasonably likely to be
materially prejudicial to the validity or enforceability of the security created or cause
an Event of Default to occur.

4.2 After a notice has been served by the Facility Agent in accordance with clause 28.18
(Acceleration) or clause 28.19 (Super Senior Acceleration), the voting and dividend receipt
rights may only be exercised by the Security Agent.

4.3 Where any charged shares are in certificated form, the original share certificates together
with (where customary) unstamped blank share transfer forms will be delivered to the
Security Agent.

4.4 Security over shares will, where possible, automatically charge any further shares issued.

5. REAL ESTATE

5.1 First ranking mortgages or fixed charges shall not be granted over any real estate if the
aggregate value (as calculated by reference to the most recent Valuation) of each Site that
is subject to a legal mortgage or standard security in favour of the Security Agent pursuant
to this agreement has been perfected by registration at HM Land Registry or Registers of
Scotland (as applicable) is at least equal to Â£425,000,000.

5.2 Any such Security shall be subject to any prior rights of any freeholder or third party which
are not waived and subject to any applicable third party consents, but the relevant grantor
of such security will use all reasonable endeavours to obtain any necessary consent from
the freeholder, superior leaseholder or any other third party.

5.3 There shall be no requirement to investigate title or provide surveys or other due diligence
unless it is either material freehold property with a value exceeding Â£5,000,000 (or its
equivalent in other currencies) or long leasehold property with an unexpired term of more
than 25 years from the date of the relevant Transaction Security or, if later, the date on
which such leasehold property is acquired by the Group.

6. RECEIVABLES

6.1 Receivables of an Obligor will be collected by that Obligor in the ordinary course of its
business. The Obligors will be entitled to use the proceeds of the receivables in accordance
with the terms of the Finance Documents until notice has been served by the Facility Agent
in accordance with clause 28.18 (Acceleration) or clause 28.19 (Super Senior Acceleration).

6.2 Notices of assignment/charge will be delivered within five Business Days of the date of the
relevant security document (or, if later, as soon as reasonably practicable following the
establishment of any new material insurance policy) to the relevant insurers in respect of
material insurance policies (other than any insurance policies relating to third party liability
or public liability or directors' and officers' insurance). There will be no requirement for the
Security Agent to be named as sole loss payee or co-insured in respect of any insurance
policy.

6.3 Any security over customer contracts will be secured by way of a general charge of
receivables only. Accordingly there will be no requirement to notify trade creditors of any
security over receivables or to provide periodic updates of the nature of such receivables
prior to notice being served by the Facility Agent in accordance with clause 28.18
(Acceleration) or clause 28.19 (Super Senior Acceleration).

6.4 Security over receivables shall be subject to any restrictions on charging or assigning in the
underlying contract.

6.5 Any obligation to procure the acknowledgement of a notice of assignment or charge by a
third party shall be limited to the relevant company using its reasonable endeavours to
procure such acknowledgment.

7. ACCOUNTS

Until notice has been served by the Facility Agent in accordance with clause 28.18
(Acceleration) or clause 28.19 (Super Senior Acceleration), the Obligors will be free to
withdraw cash from their bank accounts to make payments permitted by the Finance
Documents.

23
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Security will be granted over material intellectual property which is necessary to the
carrying out of the Group's business.

9. POWER OF ATTORNEY

Where customary or necessary, a Transaction Security Document will contain a power of
attorney allowing the Security Agent (and/or any other relevant person) to perform on
behalf of the grantor of the Security its obligations under that document following a breach
by the grantor in complying with any further assurance or perfection obligations or following
notice having been served by the Facility Agent in accordance with clause 28.18
(Acceleration) or clause 28.19 (Super Senior Acceleration).

10. UNDERTAKINGS/REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

10.1 Any representations, warranties or undertakings which are required to be included in any
Transaction Security Document shall:

(a) reflect (to the extent to which the subject matter of such representation, warranty
and undertaking is the same as the corresponding representation, warranty and
undertaking in this agreement) the commercial deal set out in this agreement, (save

Parties under the laws of the jurisdiction in which they practise);

Additional Guarantor or grant Transaction Security.

12. NON-MATERIAL COMPANIES

Company of any such member of the Group).

by the Security Agent upon the relevant Secured Parties being satisfied (acting reasonably)
that the Secured Obligations have been irrevocably and unconditionally discharged in full
and that no Secured Parties has any further obligations to provide financial accommodation
