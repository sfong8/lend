increase becomes effective in accordance with this agreement and that it is bound
by that decision to the same extent as it would have been had it been an Original
Lender.

79
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

(f) The Increase Lender shall, on the date upon which the increase takes effect, pay to
the Facility Agent (for its own account) a fee in an amount equal to the fee which
would be payable under clause 29.7 (Assignment or transfer fee) if the increase was
a transfer pursuant to clause 29.9 (Procedure for transfer) and if the Increase Lender
was a New Lender.

(g) The Parent may pay (or may procure that another Obligor pays) to the Increase

to the relevant increase;

(ii) the "New Lender" were references to that "Increase Lender"; and

(iii) a "re-transfer" and "re-assignment" were references to respectively a

Proportion of the participation in a Senior Term Facility A Loan or a Senior
Term Facility B Loan (as applicable) which the Original Committed Lenders
are required to make available pursuant to clause 5.4 (Lenders' participation)
(an "Alternative Lender Funded Amount"), to assume a Senior Term
Facility A Commitment or Senior Term Facility B Commitment (as applicable)
in an amount equal to that Alternative Lender Funded Amount (an
"Alternative Lender Assumed Commitment") and to make its
participation in a Senior Term Facility A Loan or Senior Term Facility B Loan
(as applicable) available in an amount in cash in immediately available cleared
funds equal to that Alternative Lender Funded Amount (an "Alternative
Lender Loan Participation"), in each case in place of the relevant Original
Committed Lenders;

(ii) the Facility Agent shall apply the proceeds of each Alternative Lender Funded
Amount received from an Alternative Lender which has made an election

80
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

(A) each Alternative Lender Assumed Commitment shall be attributed to
the relevant Electing Alternative Lender as if it had been an Original
Committed Lender in respect of that Alternative Lender Assumed

the relevant Original Committed Lender) (and such Electing Alternative
Lenders shall constitute an "Alternative Committed Lender"); and

(B) each Alternative Committed Lender shall assume all of the rights and
obligations as an Original Committed Lender in respect of the relevant

accordance with this clause 2.4), the Parties agree that such Alternative Lender shall:

(i) not be a Defaulting Lender; and

Commitments (as applicable) of the Committed Lenders) shall not be required
to make its participation (in an amount equal to the Alternative Lender Funded
Amount) in the relevant Senior Term Facility A Loan or Senior Term Facility B
Loan (as applicable) available; or

Alternative Lender which becomes an Alternative Committed Lender in
accordance with paragraph (a)(iii)(A) above, each Original Committed Lender
(on a several basis pro rata in accordance with the respective Senior Term
Facility A Commitments or Senior Term Facility B Commitments (as applicable)
of the Original Committed Lenders) shall be required to make its participation
in the relevant Senior Term Facility A Loan or Senior Term Facility B Loan (as
applicable) available in accordance with the Senior Term Facility A
Commitment or Senior Term Facility B Commitment (as applicable) of such
Original Committed Lender.

81
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

Commitments held by the Original Super Senior Term Facility Lenders as at the
Syndication Date, and such date falls, either:

be automatically reclassified as Senior Term Facility A Commitments and each
Original Super Senior Term Facility Lender shall, following such reclassification,
be a Lender under Senior Term Facility A; or

shall be automatically cancelled;

(b) the aggregate participations of the Original Super Senior Term Facility Lenders in
any Super Senior Term Facility Loans (the "Residual Super Senior Term Facility

reclassified as a Senior Term Facility A Loan with an Interest Period ending on the
same date as the Interest Period applicable to the Residual Super Senior Term Facility
Loans (the "Reclassified Super Senior Term Facility Loan"); and

(c) any accrued but unpaid interest in respect of the Residual Super Senior Term Facility
Loans as at the Syndication Date shall be paid at the end of the Interest Period
relating to the Reclassified Super Senior Term Facility Loan (and for the avoidance
of doubt, on and from the Syndication Date, interest shall accrue on such Reclassified
Super Senior Term Facility Loan at the rate applicable to Senior Term Facility A).

2.6 Optional Reclassification of Senior Term Facility B

Leverage (when calculated on a pro forma basis and taking into account any pro
forma adjustments referred to in the definition of "Adjusted Leverage" in clause 26.1
(Financial Definitions)) is less than or equal to 5.75:1 (or otherwise with the consent
of the Facility Agent and all Lenders under Senior Term Facility B) the Parent may,
by giving no less than ten Business Days' notice to the Facility Agent request that all
or part of the Senior Term Facility B Loans (but if in part, being an amount not less
than £5,000,000 and, if in part such reclassification shall be pro rata across the
Senior Term Facility B Loans) (the "Residual Senior Term Facility B Loans") be
reclassified as Senior Term Facility A Loans.

(b) The parties agree that, with effect from the date which falls ten Business Days after
the date of such request (the "Reclassification Date"):

as Senior Term Facility A Loans with an Interest Period ending on the same
date as the Interest Period applicable to the Residual Senior Term Facility B
Loans (the "Reclassified Senior Term Facility B Loans") and the
corresponding Senior Term Facility B Commitments shall be automatically
reclassified as Senior Term Facility A Commitments;

(ii) each Lender under each Residual Senior Term Facility B Loan shall, following
such reclassification, be a Lender under Senior Term Facility A; and

B Loans as at the Reclassification Date shall be paid at the end of the Interest
Period relating to such Reclassified Senior Term Facility B Loans (and for the
avoidance of doubt, on and from the Reclassification Date, interest shall
accrue on such Reclassified Senior Term Facility B Loans at the rate applicable
to Senior Term Facility A).

82
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

(c) On the Reclassification Date the Parent shall pay, or procure the payment, to the
Arranger an adjustment fee in the amount and at the times agreed in a Fee Letter.

clause 26.1 (Financial definitions) and where, for this purpose only, the Relevant
Period for the purpose of the definition of Relevant Period is the period of 12 months
ending on or around the date falling six months after the Closing Date) is greater
than 5.75:1 (a "Mandatory Conversion Event"), the date falling six months after
the Closing Date; and

(b) the date falling 18 months after the Closing Date,

(such earlier date being, the "Mandatory Reclassification Date"), the parties agree that:

Commitments held by the Original Super Senior Term Facility Lenders as at
the Mandatory Reclassification Date, shall be automatically cancelled;

the Interest Period relating to such Reclassified Senior Term Facility B Loans
(and for the avoidance of doubt, on and from the Mandatory Reclassification
Date, interest shall accrue on such Reclassified Senior Term Facility B Loans
at the rate applicable to Senior Term Facility A); and

(v) on the Mandatory Reclassification Date the Parent shall pay, or procure the
payment, to the Arranger an adjustment fee in the amount and at the times
agreed in a Fee Letter.

2.8 Finance Parties' rights and obligations

(a) The obligations of each Finance Party under the Finance Documents are several.
Failure by a Finance Party to perform its obligations under the Finance Documents
does not affect the obligations of any other Party under the Finance Documents. No
Finance Party is responsible for the obligations of any other Finance Party under the

of its relevant Affiliate in the circumstances described in paragraph (e) of clause 7.8
(Affiliates of Lenders as Ancillary Lenders)).

83
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

(b) The rights of each Finance Party under or in connection with the Finance Documents
are separate and independent rights and any debt arising under the Finance
Documents to a Finance Party from an Obligor is a separate and independent debt
in respect of which a Finance Party shall be entitled to enforce its rights in accordance
with paragraph (c) below. The rights of each Finance Party include any debt owing
to that Finance Party under the Finance Documents and, for the avoidance of doubt,
any part of a Loan or any other amount owed by an Obligor which relates to a Finance
Party's participation in a Facility or its role under a Finance Document (including any
such amount payable to the Facility Agent on its behalf) is a debt owing to that
Finance Party by that Obligor.

(c) A Finance Party may, except as specifically provided in the Finance Documents,
separately enforce its rights under or in connection with the Finance Documents.

2.9 Obligors' Agent

Accession Deed irrevocably appoints the Parent (acting through one or more
authorised signatories) to act on its behalf as its agent in relation to the Finance
Documents and irrevocably authorises:

(i) the Parent on its behalf to supply all information concerning itself
contemplated by this agreement to the Finance Parties and to give all notices
and instructions (including, in the case of a Borrower, Utilisation Requests),
to agree any Incremental Term Facility Terms and to deliver any Incremental
Term Facility Notice, to make such agreements and to effect the relevant
amendments, supplements and variations (in each case, however
fundamental) capable of being given, made or effected by any Obligor
(notwithstanding that they may increase the Obligor's obligations or otherwise
affect the Obligor) and to give confirmation as to continuation of surety
obligations, without further reference to or the consent of that Obligor; and

(ii) each Finance Party to give any notice, demand or other communication to
that Obligor pursuant to the Finance Documents to the Parent,

and in each case the Obligor shall be bound as though the Obligor itself had given
the notices and instructions (including, without limitation, any Utilisation Requests)
or executed or made the agreements or effected the amendments, supplements or
variations, or received the relevant notice, demand or other communication.

(b) Every act, omission, agreement, undertaking, settlement, waiver, amendment,
supplement, variation, notice or other communication given or made by the Obligors'
Agent or given to the Obligors' Agent under any Finance Document on behalf of
another Obligor or in connection with any Finance Document (whether or not known
to any other Obligor and whether occurring before or after such other Obligor became
an Obligor under any Finance Document) shall be binding for all purposes on that
Obligor as if that Obligor had expressly made, given or concurred with it. In the
event of any conflict between any notices or other communications of the Obligors'
Agent and any other Obligor, those of the Obligors' Agent shall prevail.

accrued interest, fees and commission owed to it (or to its Affiliate) as an
Ancillary Lender in respect of the Ancillary Facility); and

demand), each Lender and each Ancillary Lender shall (subject to paragraph (g)
below) promptly adjust (by making or receiving (as the case may be) corresponding
transfers of rights and obligations under the Finance Documents relating to Revolving

Facility bear the same proportion to the Total Revolving Outstandings as such
Lender's Revolving Facility Commitment under the Revolving Facility bears to the

adjustment is made under paragraph (b) above, then each Lender and Ancillary
Lender will make a further adjustment (by making or receiving (as the case may be)
corresponding transfers of rights and obligations under the Finance Documents
relating to Revolving Outstandings to the extent necessary) to put themselves in the
position they would have been in had the original adjustment been determined by
reference to the actual liability or, as the case may be, zero liability and not the
contingent liability.

(d) Any transfer of rights and obligations relating to Revolving Outstandings made
pursuant to this clause 7.6 shall be made for a purchase price in cash, payable at
the time of transfer, in an amount equal to those Revolving Outstandings (less any
accrued interest, fees and commission to which the transferor will remain entitled to

97

receive notwithstanding that transfer, pursuant to clause 29.14 (Pro rata interest

or in another currency which is acceptable to that Lender.

7.7 Information

Each Borrower and each Ancillary Lender shall, promptly upon request by the Facility Agent,
supply the Facility Agent with any information relating to the operation of an Ancillary
Facility (including the Ancillary Outstandings) as the Facility Agent may reasonably request
from time to time. Each Borrower consents to all such information being released to the
Facility Agent and the other Finance Parties.

7.8 Affiliates of Lenders as Ancillary Lenders

(a) Subject to the terms of this agreement, an Affiliate of a Lender may become an
Ancillary Lender. In such case, the Lender and its Affiliate shall be treated as a single
Lender whose Revolving Facility Commitment is the amount set out either opposite
the relevant Lender's name in part 2 of schedule 1 (The Original Parties) in relation
to the Revolving Facility and/or the amount of any Revolving Facility Commitment
transferred to or assumed by that Lender under this agreement, to the extent (in
each case) not cancelled, reduced or transferred by it under this agreement.

(b) The Parent shall specify any relevant Affiliate of a Lender in any notice delivered by
the Parent to the Facility Agent pursuant to paragraph (b)(i) of clause 7.2
(Availability).

(c) If a Lender assigns all of its rights and benefits or transfers all of its rights and
obligations to a New Lender, its Affiliate shall cease to have any obligations under
this agreement or any Ancillary Document.

(d) An Affiliate of a Lender which becomes an Ancillary Lender shall accede to the
Intercreditor Agreement as an Ancillary Lender and any person which so accedes to
the Intercreditor Agreement shall, at the same time, become a Party as an "Ancillary
Lender" in accordance with clause 21.11 (Creditor Accession Undertaking) of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

(e) Where this agreement or any other Finance Document imposes an obligation on an

performed by its Affiliate.

clause 31.3 (Resignation of a Borrower), its Affiliate shall cease to have any rights
under this agreement or any Ancillary Document.

Borrower under an Ancillary Facility and the relevant Borrower is an Affiliate of a
Borrower which is not a party to that document, the relevant Borrower shall ensure
that the obligation is performed by its Affiliate.

(e) Any reference in this agreement or any other Finance Document to a Borrower being
under no obligations (whether actual or contingent) as a Borrower under such
Finance Document shall be construed to include a reference to any Affiliate of a
Borrower being under no obligations under any Finance Document or Ancillary
Document.

7.10 Revolving Facility Commitment amounts

Notwithstanding any other term of this agreement, each Lender shall ensure that at all
times its Revolving Facility Commitment is not less than:

(a) its Ancillary Commitment; or

(b) where relevant, the Ancillary Commitment of its Affiliate,

made available under such Term Facility.

7.11 Amendments and waivers – Ancillary Facilities

No amendment or waiver of a term of any Ancillary Facility shall require the consent of any
Finance Party other than the relevant Ancillary Lender unless such amendment or waiver
itself relates to or gives rise to a matter which would require an amendment of or under
this agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, under this clause 7). In such a case,
clause 41 (Amendments and waivers) will apply.

(b) Without prejudice to each Borrower's obligation under paragraph (a) above, if:

(i) one or more Revolving Facility Loans are to be made available to a Borrower:

(A) on the same day that a maturing Revolving Facility Loan is due to be
repaid by that Borrower;

(B) in the same currency as the maturing Revolving Facility Loan (unless

(bb) each Lender will be required to make a payment under clause
35.1 (Payments to the Facility Agent) in respect of its
participation in the new Revolving Facility Loans only to the
extent that its participation in the new Revolving Facility Loans

Facility Loan and the remainder of that Lender's participation in
the new Revolving Facility Loans shall be treated as having been
made available and applied by the Borrower in or towards
repayment of that Lender's participation in the maturing
Revolving Facility Loan.

(c) At any time when a Lender under the Revolving Facility becomes a Defaulting Lender,
the maturity date of each of the participations of that Lender in the Revolving Facility
Loans then outstanding under such Revolving Facility will be automatically extended
to the Termination Date applicable to such Revolving Facility and will be treated as
separate Revolving Facility Loans under such Revolving Facility (the "Separate
Loans") denominated in the currency in which the relevant participations are
outstanding.

(d) If the Borrower makes a prepayment of a Revolving Facility Loan pursuant to clause

Separate Loan is outstanding under the same Revolving Facility may prepay that
Loan by giving not less than three Business Days' prior notice to the Facility Agent.
The proportion borne by the amount of the prepayment of the Separate Loan to the
amount of the Separate Loans shall not exceed the proportion borne by the amount
of the prepayment of a Revolving Facility Loan to the Revolving Facility Loans, in
each case, under the Revolving Facility. The Facility Agent will forward a copy of a
prepayment notice received in accordance with this paragraph (d) to the Defaulting
Lender concerned as soon as practicable on receipt.

selected by the Borrower by the time and date specified by the Facility Agent (acting

Loan.

continue to apply to Separate Loans other than to the extent inconsistent with

of any Separate Loan.

"Prepayment Period" shall have the meaning given to it in paragraph (b)(i) or
(b)(ii) of this clause 13.12, as the context requires;

"Relevant Prepayment" means a prepayment of all or any part of a Senior Term
Facility A Loan (including, for the avoidance of doubt, but subject to paragraphs (A)

to the date falling 18 months after the Closing Date of all or any part
of a Senior Term Facility B Loan which has been reclassified as a Senior
Term Facility A Loan in accordance with paragraph (a) of clause 2.7
(Mandatory Reclassification of Senior Term Facility B) (the "Converted
Facility B Amount") shall be expressly excluded from this definition
(and no prepayment fee shall be paid with respect to such prepayment);
and

(B) for the purposes of this definition only, any Converted Facility B
Prepayment shall be deemed to be applied in prepayment of the
Converted Facility B Amount until that Converted Facility B Amount has
been prepaid in full, rather than being applied across all Senior Term
Facility A Loans (including the Converted Facility B Amount) pro rata;

"Relevant Prepayment Amount" shall have the meaning given to it in paragraph
(b)(i) or (b)(ii) of this clause 13.12, as the context requires;

(b) Calculation of Senior Term Facility A Prepayment Fees

(i) If, between the Closing Date and the Last Day of the Non Call Period (such
period constituting a "Prepayment Period") there is a Relevant Prepayment,
the principal amount of which, when aggregated with the principal amount of
all other Relevant Prepayments previously made in that Prepayment Period
exceeds an aggregate amount equal to the Prepayment Deductible (the
amount of such Relevant Prepayment which is in excess of the amount of the
Prepayment Deductible for that Prepayment Period being the "Relevant
Prepayment Amount"), that Relevant Prepayment may only be made if, in
addition to all other sums required to be paid under this agreement in

pays to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Senior Term Facility A
Lenders) a prepayment fee in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the Make

(such period constituting a "Prepayment Period") there is a Relevant
Prepayment, the principal amount of which, when aggregated with the
principal amount of all other Relevant Prepayments previously made in that
Prepayment Period exceeds an aggregate amount equal to the Prepayment
Deductible (the amount of such Relevant Prepayment which is in excess of
the amount of the Prepayment Deductible for that Prepayment Period being
the "Relevant Prepayment Amount"), that Relevant Prepayment may only
be made if, in addition to all other sums required to be paid under this
agreement in connection with such Relevant Prepayment, the Parent (or
another Obligor) pays to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Senior Term
Facility A Lenders) a prepayment fee of two per cent of the Relevant
Prepayment Amount.

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, no premium or fee shall be payable under
paragraphs (i) or (ii) above in relation to any prepayment made pursuant to:

(A) clause 10.1 (Illegality);

(B) clause 11.2 (Disposal, Insurance, Listing and Acquisition Proceeds),

Facility A where such Senior Term Facility A Lender's participation in
that refinancing (including any participation in that refinancing of its
Affiliates or Related Funds) is at least equal to the aggregate
Commitments under Senior Term Facility A of such Senior Term Facility
A Lender and its Affiliates and Related Funds as at the date of such
refinancing. If, following the refinancing of Senior Term Facility A, the
aggregate Commitments of a Senior Term Facility A Lender and its
Affiliates and Related Funds is less than the aggregate Commitments
of that Senior Term Facility A Lender and its Affiliates and Related
Funds under Senior Term Facility A as at the date of such refinancing
(such difference being the "Commitments Shortfall"), then that
Senior Term Facility A Lender and its Affiliates and Related Funds shall
receive (pro rata to their Commitments under Senior Term Facility A)
a prepayment fee calculated in accordance with paragraph (b) above
and where the amount prepaid shall be treated for these purposes as
the Commitments Shortfall; or

(B) any prepayment which constitutes a Converted Facility B Prepayment
which is made on or prior to the date falling 18 months after the Closing
Date.

14. INTEREST

(a) Margin; and

(b) Term Reference Rate.

14.2 Calculation of interest – Compounded Rate Loans

(a) The rate of interest on each Compounded Rate Loan for any day during the Interest
Period is the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate of the applicable:

Banking Day, the rate of interest on that Compounded Rate Loan for that day will be
the rate applicable to the immediately preceding RFR Banking Day.

14.3 Margin adjustment

EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

(a) Subject to the other provisions in this clause 14.3 and to clause 41.8 (ESG
amendments), provided that the Facility Agent has received the ESG Compliance
Certificate for the most recently ended Ratings Period in accordance with clause 25.5
(ESG Information) and provided further that no Event of Default has occurred, the
applicable Margin for a Senior Term Facility A Loan will be subject to an adjustment
determined by reference to the Group's ESG performance as set out in the table
below, as confirmed in the most recently delivered ESG Compliance Certificate (the
amount of any increase to the Margin being the "ESG Premium" and the amount
of any reduction to the Margin being the "ESG Discount"):

ESG performance for the most Senior Term Facility A Loan Margin
recently ended Ratings Period adjustment

Group Rating is 5 per cent or more The applicable Margin shall be reduced
above the National Benchmark by 0.05 per cent per annum

Group Rating is less than 5 per cent The applicable Margin shall not be
above (but 5 per cent or less below) the adjusted
National Benchmark

Group Rating is more than 5 per cent The applicable Margin shall be increased
below the National Benchmark by 0.05 per cent per annum

(b) Any change in the Margin for a Senior Term Facility A Loan pursuant to this clause
14.3 will apply from the date which is five Business Days after the date of receipt by
the Lender of the relevant ESG Compliance Certificate delivered pursuant to clause
25.5 (ESG Information).

(c) Any amount payable by the Group in respect of an ESG Premium shall be payable in
accordance with clause 14.4 (Payment of Interest).

(d) Any ESG Discount shall not be effective for any period during which an Event of
Default is continuing, provided that any applicable ESG Discount shall apply from the
date such Event of Default ceased to be continuing.

(e) A failure by the Parent to deliver an ESG Compliance Certificate in accordance with
clause 25.5 (ESG Information) shall result in there being no adjustment to the Margin
under paragraph (a) above for any Interest Period which ends between the date on
which such ESG Compliance Certificate should have been delivered in accordance
with clause 25.5 (ESG Information) and the date on which the next ESG Compliance
Certificate is delivered in accordance with clause 25.5 (ESG Information).

(f) If an ESG Discount is applicable, the Parent shall arrange for an amount equal to 50
per cent of such ESG Discount to be applied in payment to an ESG Project over the
course of the following twelve month period, and shall confirm that such payment
has been made in the ESG Compliance Certificate.

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, at no time shall the increase or reduction to the Margin
applicable pursuant to paragraph (a) above exceed 0.05 per cent per annum and,
accordingly, the relevant ESG Premium or ESG Discount will never be more than 0.05
per cent per annum as a consequence of the operation of this clause 14.3.

14.4 Payment of interest

(b) If the Annual Financial Statements and related Compliance Certificate received by
the Facility Agent show that a higher or lower Margin should have applied during a
certain period, then, where a higher Margin should have applied, the Parent shall (or

(a) The Parent may elect, by written notice to the Facility Agent no later than 10 Business
Days prior to the end of an Interest Period in respect of a Senior Term Facility A Loan
(which Interest Period was no longer than three months), to reduce the Margin in

of one per cent per annum), provided that any such reduction in the Margin shall not
result in the Margin that is payable in cash in relation to that Loan being less than

exercised, then, subject to paragraph (e) below, the accrued interest on that Loan
shall be the aggregate of:

the Parent has elected to make subject to the PIK Toggle Option (such
percentage the "PIK Percentage"), which shall be paid in cash;

(ii) the PIK Percentage plus 0.25 per cent for each 1.00 per cent of PIK Percentage,
which shall be capitalised and treated as increasing the principal amount of
the relevant Loan on which it accrues; and

(iii) the applicable Term Reference Rate or Compounded Reference Rate for that
Loan, which shall be paid in cash,

in each case, on the last day of such Interest Period (and, if the Interest Period is
longer than six Months, on the dates falling at six Monthly intervals after the first
day of the Interest Period).

(b) Any valid election made pursuant to paragraph (a) above shall apply to the Interest
Period to which it relates but not for any subsequent Interest Period unless another
valid election is made for a subsequent Interest Period.

(c) The PIK Toggle Option may not be exercised in more than three consecutive Interest
Periods.

(d) All amounts of interest capitalised pursuant to paragraph (a)(ii) above, must be
repaid in full (in cash) on the Termination Date applicable to that Facility.

absence of the any valid election made pursuant to paragraph (a) above an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, the PIK Toggle Option shall not be deemed a
valid election and the applicable Margin shall be paid in full in cash on the last day
of the relevant Interest Period.

have been payable if the overdue amount had, during the period of non-payment,
constituted a Loan of the same type as the Loan in respect of which the overdue
amount has arisen or, if the unpaid amount did not arise in respect of a particular
Loan, a Senior Term Facility A Loan, in the currency of the overdue amount for

and in each case, the Borrower has notified that Lender in writing, that Lender
and the Borrower shall co-operate in completing any additional procedural
formalities necessary for that Borrower to obtain authorisation to make that
payment without a Tax Deduction.

(i) If a Lender has not confirmed its scheme reference number and jurisdiction of tax
residence in accordance with paragraph (g)(ii) above, no Obligor shall make a

Protected Party in respect of a Finance Document.

(b) Paragraph (a) above shall not apply:

(i) with respect to any Tax assessed on a Finance Party:

(A) under the law of the jurisdiction in which that Finance Party is
incorporated or, if different, the jurisdiction (or jurisdictions) in which
that Finance Party is treated as resident for tax purposes; or

(B) under the law of the jurisdiction in which that Finance Party's Facility
Office is located, or in which that Finance Party is otherwise taxed by
reason of a permanent establishment, branch or agency, in respect of
amounts received or receivable in that jurisdiction,

to the extent that Tax is imposed on or calculated by reference to the net
income received or receivable (but not any sum deemed to be received or
receivable) by that Finance Party; or

134
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

(B) would have been compensated for by an increased payment under
clause 18.2 (Tax gross-up) but was not so compensated solely because
one of the exclusions in paragraph (d) of clause 18.2 (Tax gross-up)
applied; or

(C) relates to a FATCA Deduction required to be made by a Party;

(D) is a liability to stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax which is dealt with

18.4 Tax Credit

(a) If an Obligor makes a Tax Payment and the relevant Finance Party (acting reasonably)
determines that a Tax Credit is attributable to an increased payment of which that
Tax Payment forms part, to that Tax Payment or to a Tax Deduction in consequence
of which that Tax Payment was required the relevant Finance Party shall use
reasonable endeavours to obtain and utilise that Tax Credit, provided that the
relevant Finance Party shall not be required to utilise the Tax Credit attributable to
an increased payment of which that Tax Payment forms part, to that Tax Payment
or to a Tax Deduction in consequence of which that Tax Payment was required in
priority to using any other Tax Credit available to the Finance Party to the extent
that to do so would jeopardise or delay the availability of any other such Tax Credit.

(b) If and when that Finance Party has obtained and utilised the Tax Credit that was
attributable to an increased payment of which that Tax Payment forms part, to that
Tax Payment or to a Tax Deduction in consequence of which that Tax Payment was
required, the Finance Party shall pay an amount to the Obligor which that Finance
Party determines will leave it (after that payment) in the same after-Tax position as
it would have been in had the Tax Payment not been required to be made by the
Obligor.

18.5 Lender status confirmation

Each Lender which is not an Original Lender shall confirm, in the documentation which it
executes on becoming a Party, and for the benefit of the Facility Agent and without liability
to any Obligors, which of the following categories it falls in:

(a) not a Qualifying Lender;

(b) a Qualifying Lender (other than a Treaty Lender or an Exempt Lender); or

(c) an Exempt Lender; or

(d) a Treaty Lender.

If such a Lender fails to confirm its status in accordance with this clause 18.5 then that
Lender shall be treated for the purposes of this agreement (including by each Obligor) as if
it is not a Qualifying Lender until such time as it notifies the Facility Agent which category
applies (and the Facility Agent, upon receipt of such notification, shall inform the Parent).

135
EUS\HCB\400080815 15

The Parent shall pay and, within three Business Days of demand, indemnify (or shall procure
that a Borrower shall pay and indemnify) each Secured Party against any cost, loss or

Taxes payable in respect of any Finance Document (save for any such Taxes payable in
respect of an assignment or transfer of a Lender's interests in respect of any Finance

the Lenders))).

(a) All amounts expressed to be payable under a Finance Document by any Party to a
Finance Party which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for any supply
for VAT purposes are deemed to be exclusive of any VAT which is chargeable on that
supply, and accordingly, subject to paragraph (b) below, if VAT is or becomes
chargeable on any supply made by any Finance Party to any Party under a Finance
Document and such Finance Party is required to account to the relevant tax authority
for the VAT, that Party must pay to such Finance Party (in addition to and at the
same time as paying any other consideration for such supply) an amount equal to
the amount of the VAT (and such Finance Party must promptly provide an appropriate
VAT invoice to that Party).

(b) If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Finance Party (the
"Supplier") to any other Finance Party (the "Recipient") under a Finance
Document, and any Party other than the Recipient (the "Relevant Party") is
required by the terms of any Finance Document to pay an amount equal to the
consideration for that supply to the Supplier (rather than being required to reimburse
or indemnify the Recipient in respect of that consideration):

(i) (where the Supplier is the person required to account to the relevant tax
authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must also pay to the Supplier (at
the same time as paying that amount) an additional amount equal to the
amount of the VAT. The Recipient must (where this paragraph (i) applies)
promptly pay to the Relevant Party an amount equal to any credit or
repayment the Recipient receives from the relevant tax authority which the
Recipient reasonably determines relates to the VAT chargeable on that supply;
and

(ii) (where the Recipient is the person required to account to the relevant tax
authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must promptly, following demand
from the Recipient, pay to the Recipient an amount equal to the VAT
chargeable on that supply but only to the extent that the Recipient reasonably
determines that it is not entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant tax
authority in respect of that VAT.

(c) Where a Finance Document requires any Party to reimburse or indemnify a Finance
Party for any cost or expense, that Party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case
may be) such Finance Party for the full amount of such cost or expense, including
such part thereof as represents VAT, save to the extent that such Finance Party
reasonably determines that it is entitled to credit or repayment in respect of such
VAT from the relevant tax authority.

136

-----

(d) Any reference in this clause 18.7 to any Party shall, at any time when such Party is
treated as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and
unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to the representative member of
such group at such time (the term "representative member" to have the same
meaning as in the Value Added Tax Act 1994).

(e) In relation to any supply made by a Finance Party to any Party under a Finance
Document, if reasonably requested by such Finance Party, that Party must promptly
provide such Finance Party with details of that Party's VAT registration and such
other information as is reasonably requested in connection with such Finance Party's
VAT reporting requirements in relation to such supply.

18.8 FATCA information

(a) Subject to paragraph (c) below, each Party shall, within ten Business Days of a
reasonable request by another Party:

(i) confirm to that other Party whether it is:

(A) a FATCA Exempt Party; or

(B) not a FATCA Exempt Party;

(ii) supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other information
relating to its status under FATCA as that other Party reasonably requests for
the purposes of that other Party's compliance with FATCA; and

(iii) supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other information
relating to its status as that other Party reasonably requests for the purposes
of that other Party's compliance with any other law, regulation, or exchange
of information regime.

(b) If a Party confirms to another Party pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) above that it is a
FATCA Exempt Party and it subsequently becomes aware that it is not or has ceased
to be a FATCA Exempt Party, that Party shall notify that other Party reasonably
promptly.

(c) Paragraph (a) above shall not oblige any Finance Party to do anything, and paragraph
(a)(iii) above shall not oblige any other Party to do anything, which would or might
in its reasonable opinion constitute a breach of:

(i) any law or regulation;

(ii) any fiduciary duty; or

(iii) any duty of confidentiality.

(d) If a Party fails to confirm whether or not it is a FATCA Exempt Party or to supply
forms, documentation or other information requested in accordance with paragraph
(a)(i) or (a)(ii) above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, where paragraph (c)
above applies), then such Party shall be treated for the purposes of the Finance
Documents (and payments under them) as if it is not a FATCA Exempt Party until
such time as the Party in question provides the requested confirmation, forms,
documentation or other information.

18.9 FATCA Deduction

(a) Each Party may make any FATCA Deduction it is required to make by FATCA, and
any payment required in connection with that FATCA Deduction, and no Party shall

-----

be required to increase any payment in respect of which it makes such a FATCA
Deduction or otherwise compensate the recipient of the payment for that FATCA
Deduction.

(b) Each Party shall promptly, upon becoming aware that it must make a FATCA
Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of such FATCA
Deduction), notify the Party to whom it is making the payment and, in addition, shall
notify the Parent and the Facility Agent and the Facility Agent shall notify the other
Finance Parties.

it or any Finance Party) including:

to the benefit of the same; and

26.3 Financial testing

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, the financial covenants set out in clause 26.2
(Financial condition)shall be calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles
used in the Base Case Model (with such amendments as are agreed with the Majority
Lenders and the Majority Super Senior Facility Lenders) and tested by reference to
each of the financial statements delivered pursuant to paragraphs (a)(i) and (b) of
clause 25.1 (Financial statements) and/or each Compliance Certificate delivered
pursuant to clause 25.2 (Provision and contents of Compliance Certificate).

(b) So long as any cost savings or cost synergies included as Permitted Synergies are
projected as being realisable at any time during the Relevant Period, it may be
assumed that such cost savings or cost synergies will be realisable during the entire
such period, provided that any such pro forma increase to EBITDA shall be without
duplication for cost savings or cost synergies actually realised during such period and
already included in EBITDA.

(c) Any component of EBITDA denominated in a currency other than the Base Currency
shall be converted into the Base Currency for the purpose of calculating EBITDA on
the basis of the exchange rate used in the relevant financial statements (consistently
applied) and any Borrowings denominated in a currency other than the Base
Currency shall be converted into the Base Currency for the purpose of calculating
Total Net Debt on the basis of:

(i) where a member of the Group has entered into a foreign exchange rate
hedging arrangement in respect of any Financial Indebtedness, the relevant
fixed exchange rate under such hedging arrangement to the extent of the
amount of Financial Indebtedness which is so hedged; or

(ii) in respect of other Financial Indebtedness, the weighted average exchange
rates used in determining EBITDA for the Relevant Period in the relevant
financial statements (consistently applied).

(d) For the purpose of the financial covenants set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause
26.2 (Financial condition) (and any other calculation of Adjusted Leverage under this
agreement) for each of the Relevant Periods ending on a date which is less than 12
months after the Closing Date, EBITDA shall be calculated by reference to the period
of 12 months ending on the last day of such Relevant Period (and, where such 12
month period includes a period before the Closing Date, EBITDA shall be determined
by reference to the Target Group before such date).

26.4 Equity Cure

(a) Subject to paragraphs (b) to (e) below, if an Event of Default or Material Event of
Default occurs or the Parent is concerned that it would otherwise occur under clause
28.2 (Financial covenants and other obligations) in respect of a breach of paragraphs
(a) and/or (b) of clause 26.2 (Financial condition) (each a "Curable Default"), no
Event of Default or Material Event of Default will occur if:

(i) by no later than the date falling ten Business Days after the earlier of the date
of the Compliance Certificate evidencing the Curable Default and the date
upon which such Compliance Certificate should have been delivered under
clause 25 (Information undertakings), the Parent has notified the Facility
Agent that it intends to effect a cure pursuant to this clause; and

175
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

(ii) by no later than the date falling 25 Business Days after the earlier of the date
of the Compliance Certificate evidencing the Curable Default and the date
upon which such Compliance Certificate should have been delivered under
clause 25 (Information undertakings), the Company has received the
proceeds of a New Shareholder Injection to be applied under this clause 26.4
which are of a sufficient amount to remedy the Curable Default (the amount
of such received funds being the "Equity Cure Amount") in accordance with
paragraph (b) below.

(b) Once the Equity Cure Amount has been received by the Company the financial
covenants set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 26.2 (Financial condition) shall
be retested, at the Parent's election by either:

(i) deeming Borrowings under the Facilities to be decreased by such Equity Cure
Amount (pro rata across the Facilities) as of the first day of the Relevant
Period in which the Curable Default occurred, or the Parent anticipated it
would have occurred if this clause was not invoked, and, if and only to the
extent that the Equity Cure Amount remains on the Group's balance sheet as
Cash or is invested as a Cash Equivalent Investment, the next three Relevant
Periods; or

(ii) subject to paragraph (e)(viii) below, once during the life of the Facilities only,
deeming EBITDA to be increased by an amount equal to (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, no greater than) the amount required to cure the Curable
Default (such amount being, the "Minimum Equity Cure Amount") as of
the first day of the Relevant Period in which the Curable Default occurred, or
the Parent anticipated it would have occurred if this clause was not invoked,
and the next three Relevant Periods.

(c) If, after Borrowings are deemed decreased, or (as applicable) EBITDA is increased
under paragraph (b) above, the financial covenants are complied with, the Parent
shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of the financial covenants as of
the relevant testing dates with the same effect as if there had been no breach of
those financial covenants and, if applicable, that Curable Default shall be deemed
remedied for all purposes under the Finance Documents.

(d) The Group may only exercise its rights under paragraph (a) above:

(i) four times before the Termination Date of the Super Senior Term Facility; and

(ii) (without prejudice to the deemed application of an Equity Cure Amount in
respect of three further Relevant Periods referred to in paragraph (b) above
in respect of any Curable Default pursuant to paragraphs (a) and/or (b) of
clause 26.2 (Financial condition)) not in respect of two consecutive Relevant
Periods.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt:

(i) if within 25 Business Days of the earlier of the date of the Compliance
Certificate evidencing the Curable Default or the date upon which such
Compliance Certificate should have been delivered under clause 25
(Information undertakings), the Company has not received sufficient of the
funds referred to in paragraph (a) above to remedy the relevant Curable
Default in accordance with this clause 26.4, the Finance Parties will be
permitted to take any action available to them specified in clause 28.18
(Acceleration) or clause 28.19 (Super Senior Acceleration), as applicable,
immediately upon the expiry of that period;

176
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

(ii) this clause 26.4 shall not restrict the ability of any Finance Party to take action
under clause 28.18 (Acceleration) in respect of any other Event of Default, or
under clause 28.19 (Super Senior Acceleration) in respect of any other
Material Event of Default, in each case which is not a Curable Default being
remedied in accordance with paragraph (a) above;

(iii) any Equity Cure Amount shall be applied as contemplated by paragraph (b)
above even if the Parent may have complied with one or more of the financial
covenants in clause 26.2 (Financial condition) in the absence of such
application, provided that:

(A) such Equity Cure Amount applied in respect of any Curable Default
pursuant to paragraph (a) of clause 26.2 (Financial condition) shall be
applied in the same way in respect of paragraph (b) of clause 26.2
(Financial condition);

(B) its application in respect of paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 26.2
(Financial condition) shall count only as one exercise of its rights under
paragraph (a) above; and

(C) where the Parent has elected to apply the Minimum Equity Cure
Amount as contemplated by paragraph (b)(ii) above, its application in
respect of paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 26.2 (Financial condition)
shall count only as one exercise of its rights under paragraph (b)(ii)
above;

(iv) save as contemplated in paragraph (vi) below, no part of the Equity Cure
Amount shall be required to be applied in prepayment of the Facilities;

(v) where the Parent has elected to apply the Equity Cure Amount as
contemplated by paragraph (b)(i) above, there shall be no limit on the amount
of the Equity Cure Amount;

(vi) where the Parent has elected to apply the Minimum Equity Cure Amount as
contemplated by paragraph (b)(ii) above but the relevant Equity Cure Amount
is greater than the Minimum Equity Cure Amount, EBITDA shall only be
increased by an amount equal to the Minimum Equity Cure Amount, and the
difference between the Equity Cure Amount and the Minimum Equity Cure
Amount shall be deemed to reduce Borrowings in accordance with paragraph
(b)(i) above;

(vii) any recalculation of the financial covenants in paragraphs (a) or (b) of clause
26.2 (Financial condition) made under this clause 26.4 will be solely for the
purpose of curing a relevant breach of that paragraph and not for any other
purpose, including (without limitation) the calculation of Margin, in the
definitions of Permitted Payment or Permitted Acquisition, the calculation of
the Listing Proceeds to be applied in mandatory prepayment of the Facility in
clause 11 (Mandatory prepayment and cancellation), any Utilisation of the
Incremental Term Facility;

(viii) there shall be no double counting under this clause 26.4 in respect of any
Equity Cure Amount received by the Group (including, without limitation, in
respect of any voluntary prepayment of some or all of the Equity Cure Amount
or any Equity Cure Amount that remains on balance sheet as Cash or which
has been invested as a Cash Equivalent Investment); and

(ix) no Default or Material Event of Default shall arise in relation to the financial

condition) in respect of a Relevant Period (the "First Period") but the Parent is in
compliance with all its obligations under clause 26.2 (Financial condition) in respect

Agent (acting on behalf of the Lenders or the Super Senior Facility Lenders, as
applicable) has not exercised any of the rights set out in clause 28.18 (Acceleration)
or clause 28.19 (Super Senior Acceleration), then the breach of such obligations in

to in paragraph (a) above shall be a breach of clause 26.2 (Financial condition) until

(Acceleration) or clause 28.19 (Super Senior Acceleration), in respect of such breach

economics of such assignment, transfer or sub-participation (such right, a
"Right to Match") provided that the Parent or the Investors advise the
relevant lender of their intention to exercise the Right to Match no later than
two Business Days prior to the proposed date of the relevant assignment,
transfer or sub-participation.

(c) If the Parent or Investors exercises the Right to Match, the relevant Lender shall only
be permitted to:

(ii) to another Lender or an Affiliate of any Lender;

(iii) to a fund which is a Related Fund of that Existing Lender; or

(iv) made at a time when a Relevant Event of Default is continuing,

provided that any assignment or transfer to be made on or prior to the end of the
Certain Funds Period shall in all circumstances require the prior written consent of
the Parent (which may be given or refused in its absolute discretion and, for the
avoidance of doubt, never deemed given) unless such assignment or transfer is:

(A) to another Original Committed Lender; or

(B) made at a time when a Major Default is continuing.

consent to an assignment or transfer if it is to a Loan to Own Investor,
competitor of the Sponsor or Defaulting Lender.

(c) A request to the Parent for consent pursuant to paragraph (a) above shall
simultaneously be sent to the Investors. For the avoidance of doubt, there shall be

no requirement to consult with, or obtain the consent of, the Investors to any
assignment or transfer by an Existing Lender.

29.3 Pre-Approved New Lender List

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, the Pre-Approved New Lender List may be amended

Majority Lenders) and the Parent provided that the total number of banks and
financial institutions on the Pre-Approved New Lender List is not reduced at any time.

(b) The Parent may, subject to giving five Business Days' prior notice to the Facility
Agent, in its sole discretion:

(i) add up to two new persons to the Pre-Approved New Lender List per Financial
Year;

(ii) remove up to five persons from the Pre-Approved New Lender List per
Financial Year provided that the Parent shall simultaneously add a new person
that is of the same type as the person removed, be that a bank or financial
institution or a trust, fund or other entity which is regularly engaged in or
established for the purpose of making, purchasing or investing in loans,
securities or other financial assets (as agreed with the Facility Agent, each
acting in good faith) to the Pre-Approved New Lender List in place of each
person removed; and

(iii) remove an entity (a "Potential Transferee") from the Pre-Approved New
Lender List where such Potential Transferee has been acquired by, has merged
with or has otherwise combined its operations with, a person who is not
included in the Pre-Approved New Lender List, unless that person is
administered by persons operating behind appropriate information barriers
implemented or maintained as required by law, regulation or internal policy
and, in any event, to the extent required to ensure that such administration
is independent from that of the Potential Transferee and any information
provided under the Finance Documents is not (or is not capable of being)
disclosed or otherwise made available to such person.

(c) Any entity shall immediately be deemed removed from the Pre-Approved New Lender
List if such entity has become a Loan to Own Investor, Competitor, Sponsor
Competitor or Defaulting Lender.

(d) A Lender may at any time notify the Parent of the details of any entity it wishes to
be added to the Pre-Approved New Lender List. The addition of any such entities will
be subject to the consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of the
Parent.

(e) Any entity consented to by the Parent as a permitted transferee or assignee under
clause 29.2 (Parent consent) shall be automatically added to the Pre-Approved New
Lender List.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, an amendment to the Pre-Approved New Lender List will
be without prejudice to the effect of any assignment or transfer which is made in
accordance with clause 29 (Changes to the Lenders) prior to the date of such
amendment.

(g) The Facility Agent shall, within five Business Days of a reasonable request by any
Party, provide a copy of the Pre-Approved New Lender List to that Party.

29.4 Other conditions of assignment or transfer

(a) An assignment, transfer or sub-participation in respect of the Revolving Facility or
the Revolving Facility Commitments, shall not be made without the prior consent of
the Parent (which may be withheld or conditioned in the Parent's absolute discretion)
unless the relevant assignee, transferee or sub-participant is a deposit taking
financial institution authorised by a financial services regulator or similar regulatory
body which has a long term credit rating equal to or better than BBB- or Baa2 (as
applicable) according to at least two of Standard & Poor's Rating Services, Fitch
Ratings Ltd. or Moody's Investors Service Limited.

(b) An assignment or transfer of part (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, the whole) of
a Lender's participation must be in an amount such that the Base Currency Amount
of that Lender's remaining participation (when aggregated with its Affiliates' and
Related Funds' participation) in respect of Commitments or Loans made under the
Term Facilities (taken together) is in a minimum amount of £2,000,000, unless that
assignment or transfer is made at a time when a Relevant Event of Default is
continuing.

(c) (Other than in the case of an assignment permitted by paragraph (b) of clause 30.1
(Permitted Debt Purchase Transactions)) an assignment will only be effective on:

(i) receipt by the Facility Agent (whether in the Assignment Agreement or
otherwise) of written confirmation from the New Lender (in form and
substance satisfactory to the Facility Agent) that the New Lender will assume
the same obligations to the other Finance Parties and the other Secured
Parties as it would have been under if it had been an Original Lender;

(ii) if not already party to the Intercreditor Agreement in the relevant capacity,
the New Lender entering into the documentation required for it to accede as
a party to the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(iii) performance by the Facility Agent of all necessary "know your customer" or
other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations in relation to
such assignment to a New Lender, the completion of which the Facility Agent
shall promptly notify to the Existing Lender and the New Lender.

(d) A transfer will only be effective if the New Lender enters into the documentation
required for it to accede as a party to the Intercreditor Agreement (if not already
party to the Intercreditor Agreement in the relevant capacity) and if the procedure
set out in clause 29.9 (Procedure for transfer) is complied with.

(e) If:

(i) a Lender assigns or transfers any of its rights or obligations under the Finance
Documents or changes its Facility Office; and

(ii) as a result of circumstances existing at the date the assignment, transfer or
change occurs, an Obligor would be obliged to make a payment to the New
Lender or Lender acting through its new Facility Office under clauses 18 (Tax
gross up and indemnities) or 19 (Increased Costs),

then the New Lender or Lender acting through its new Facility Office is only entitled
to receive payment under those clauses to the same extent as the Existing Lender
or Lender acting through its previous Facility Office would have been if the
assignment, transfer or change had not occurred provided that this paragraph (e)
shall not apply in relation to clause 18.2 (Tax gross-up) to a Treaty Lender that has
included a confirmation of its HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme reference number
and jurisdiction of tax residence in accordance with paragraph (g)(ii) of clause 18.2

204
EUS\HCB\400080815 15

Filing in respect of that Treaty Lender, unless the relevant payment falls due within
10 Business Days of the transfer, assignment or change occurring.

(f) Each New Lender, by executing the relevant Transfer Certificate or Assignment
Agreement, confirms, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Facility Agent has
authority to execute on its behalf any amendment or waiver that has been approved
by or on behalf of the requisite Lender or Lenders in accordance with this agreement
on or prior to the date on which the transfer or assignment becomes effective in
accordance with this agreement and that it is bound by that decision to the same
extent as the Existing Lender would have been had it remained a Lender.

29.5 Sub-participations

(a) An Existing Lender may, subject to this clause 29.5, enter into a sub-participation
(whether funded or unfunded), sub-contract or similar arrangements (each a
"Participation Agreement") in respect of its rights and obligations under this
agreement provided that the Lender remains liable under this agreement in relation
to those rights and obligations or, to the extent any voting rights are transferred or
are capable of being transferred by the Lender, paragraph (b) below is complied with.

(b) Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, the prior written consent of the Parent is
required to any Participation Agreement pursuant to the terms of which any voting
rights of a Lender are transferred or are capable of being transferred to the respective
counterparty of the Participation Agreement unless:

(i) the counterparty to the Participation Agreement is:

(A) an entity identified on the Pre-Approved New Lender List;

(B) another Lender or an Affiliate of any Lender;

(C) a fund which is a Related Fund of that Existing Lender; or

(ii) the Participation Agreement is entered into at a time when a Relevant Event

provided that any Participation Agreement entered into on or prior to the end of the

the Parent (which may be given or refused in its absolute discretion and, for the
avoidance of doubt, never deemed given) unless such assignment or transfer is made
pursuant to paragraph (b)(i)(B) or (b)(i)(C) above.

Notwithstanding the above, no Participation Agreement may be entered into at any
time if the counterparty to that Participation Agreement is a Loan to Own Investor,
Competitor, competitor of the Sponsor or Defaulting Lender at any time.

the Certain Funds Period:

205
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

(d) A request to the Parent for consent or (applicable) notice of sub-participation under

of doubt, there shall be no requirement to consult with, or obtain the consent of, the
Sponsor to any sub-participation by an Existing Lender.

29.6 Transfer in breach of criteria – disenfranchisement

If a Lender transfers or assigns all or part of its Commitment (the "Transferred
Commitment") or enters into a Participation Agreement in respect of all or part of its
Commitment (the "Sub-participated Commitment") in breach of any requirement
contained in clause 29.2 (Parent consent), clause 29.4 (Other conditions of assignment or
transfer) or clause 29.5 (Sub-participations) (such transferee, assignee or counterparty to
the Participation Agreement (as applicable) being, in respect of the Transferred
Commitment, a "Disqualified Transferee"), as the case may be, then until and unless
the subsequent written consent of the Parent to the relevant transfer or assignment or
Participation Agreement is obtained (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed (provided that it shall be reasonable for the Parent to withhold consent in the
circumstances referred to in paragraph (b) of clause 29.2 (Parent consent) or paragraph (c)
of clause 29.5 (Sub-participations))) or deemed to be given:

(a) in ascertaining:

(i) the Majority Lenders, the Incremental Term Facility Majority Lenders, the

(A) any given percentage (including, for the avoidance of doubt, unanimity)
of the Total Commitments; or

has been obtained to approve any request for a consent, waiver, amendment
or other vote under the Finance Documents the Transferred Commitment or
the Sub-participated Commitment shall be deemed to be zero; and

(b) the Disqualified Transferee shall:

(i) in relation to any meeting or conference call to which all the Lenders are
invited to attend or participate, not attend or participate in the same or be
entitled to receive the agenda or any minutes of the same;

(ii) not be entitled to receive any report, financial information or other document
delivered in accordance with this agreement or prepared at the request of, or
on the instructions of, the Facility Agent or one or more of the Lenders; and

(iii) not be entitled to receive interest on any Loans it holds.

an assignment or transfer takes effect, pay to the Facility Agent (for its own account) a fee
of £3,500.

relied exclusively on any information provided to it by the Existing Lender or
any other Finance Party in connection with any Transaction Document or the
Transaction Security; and

(ii) will continue to make its own independent appraisal of the creditworthiness
of each Obligor and its related entities whilst any amount is or may be
outstanding under the Finance Documents or any Commitment is in force.

(c) Nothing in any Finance Document obliges an Existing Lender to:

(i) accept a re-transfer or re-assignment from a New Lender of any of the rights
and obligations assigned or transferred under this clause 29; or

(ii) support any losses directly or indirectly incurred by the New Lender by reason
of the non-performance by any Obligor of its obligations under the Transaction
Documents or otherwise.

29.9 Procedure for transfer

in respect of the Transaction Security shall be cancelled (being the
"Discharged Rights and Obligations");

one another and/or acquire rights against one another which differ from the
Discharged Rights and Obligations only insofar as that Obligor or other
member of the Group and the New Lender have assumed and/or acquired the
same in place of that Obligor and the Existing Lender;

(iii) the Facility Agent, the Arranger, the Security Agent, the New Lender, the
other Lenders and any relevant Ancillary Lender shall acquire the same rights
and assume the same obligations between themselves and in respect of the
Transaction Security as they would have acquired and assumed had the New
Lender been an Original Lender with the rights, and/or obligations acquired
or assumed by it as a result of the transfer and to that extent the Facility
Agent, the Arranger, the Security Agent and any relevant Ancillary Lender and
the Existing Lender shall each be released from further obligations to each
other under the Finance Documents; and

(iv) the New Lender shall become a Party as a "Lender".

Obligations") expressed to be the subject of the release in the Assignment
Agreement (and any corresponding obligations by which it is bound in respect
of the Transaction Security); and

(iii) the New Lender shall become a Party as a "Lender" and will be bound by
obligations equivalent to the Relevant Obligations.

(d) Lenders may utilise procedures other than those set out in this clause 29.10 to assign
their rights under the Finance Documents (but not, without the consent of the

208
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

relevant Obligor or unless in accordance with clause 29.9 (Procedure for transfer),
to obtain a release by that Obligor from the obligations owed to that Obligor by the

Agreement.

29.13 Security over Lenders' rights

In addition to the other rights provided to Lenders under this clause 29, each Lender may

any of its rights under any Finance Document to secure obligations of that Lender including,
without limitation:

(a) any charge, assignment or other Security to secure obligations to a federal reserve
or central bank; and

(b) any charge, assignment or other Security granted to any holders (or trustee or
representatives of holders) of obligations owed, or securities issued, by that Lender

substitute the beneficiary of the relevant charge, assignment or Security for
the Lender as a party to any of the Finance Documents; or

(ii) require any payments to be made by an Obligor other than or in excess of, or
grant to any person any more extensive rights than, those required to be
made or granted to the relevant Lender under the Finance Documents.

29.14 Pro rata interest settlement

(a) If the Facility Agent has notified the Lenders that it is able to distribute interest
payments on a "pro rata basis" to Existing Lenders and New Lenders then (in respect
of any transfer pursuant to clause 29.9 (Procedure for transfer) or any assignment
pursuant to clause 29.10 (Procedure for assignment) the Transfer Date of which, in
each case, is after the date of such notification and is not on the last day of an
Interest Period):

current Interest Period (or, if the Interest Period is longer than six Months, on
the next of the dates which falls at six Monthly intervals after the first day of
that Interest Period); and

(ii) the rights assigned or transferred by the Existing Lender will not include the
right to the Accrued Amounts so that, for the avoidance of doubt:

(A) when the Accrued Amounts become payable, those Accrued Amounts
will be payable for the account of the Existing Lender; and

(B) the amount payable to the New Lender on that date will be the amount
which would, but for the application of this clause 29.14, have been
payable to it on that date, but after deduction of the Accrued Amounts.

(b) In this clause 29.14 references to "Interest Period" shall be construed to include
a reference to any other period for accrual of fees.

(c) An Existing Lender which retains the right to the Accrued Amounts pursuant to this
clause 29.14 but which does not have a Commitment shall be deemed not to be a
Lender for the purposes of ascertaining whether the agreement of any specified

EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

wishing to make such an offer shall, by 11.00 a.m. on the second Business
Day following such Solicitation Day, communicate to the Purchase Agent

Lenders.

(iii) Any purchase of participations in the Term Facilities pursuant to a Solicitation
Process shall be completed and settled on or before the fifth Business Day
after the relevant Solicitation Day.

(iv) In accepting any offers made pursuant to a Solicitation Process the Parent
shall be free to select which offers and in which amounts it accepts but on the
basis that in relation to a participation in a particular Term Facility it accepts
offers in inverse order of the price offered (with the offer or offers at the
lowest price being accepted first) and that if in respect of participations in a
particular Term Facility it receives two or more offers at the same price it shall

another Purchase Agent place an open order (an "Open Order") to purchase
participations in one or more of the Term Facilities up to a set aggregate

participating in the relevant Term Facilities of the same. Any Lender wishing
to sell pursuant to an Open Order will, by 11.00 a.m. on any Business Day
following the date on which the Open Order is placed but no earlier than the
first Business Day, and no later than the fifth Business Day, following the date

Order Process shall be completed and settled by the relevant Borrower(s) on
or before the fourth Business Day after the date of the relevant offer by a
Lender to sell under the relevant Open Order.

(viii) If in respect of participations in a Term Facility the Purchase Agent receives
on the same Business Day two or more offers at the set price such that the

211
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

maximum amount of such Term Facility to which an Open Order relates would
be exceeded, the Parent shall only accept such offers on a pro rata basis.

(d) The Parent shall, by 5.00 p.m. on the sixth Business Day following the date on which
an Open Order is placed, notify the Facility Agent of the amounts of the participations
purchased through such Open Order Process and the identity of the Term Facilities
to which they relate. The Facility Agent shall promptly disclose such information to
the Lenders.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, there is no limit on the number of occasions a Solicitation
Process or an Open Order Process may be implemented.

clause 30.1, notwithstanding any other term of this agreement or the other Finance
Documents:

the Lenders), the portions of the Term Loans to which it relates shall be
extinguished;

amendment or other vote under the Finance Documents such
Commitment shall be deemed to be zero and such Sponsor Affiliate or
the person with whom it has entered into such sub-participation, other
agreement or arrangement shall be deemed not to be a Lender for the

Facility being treated in any manner which is inconsistent with the treatment
proposed to be applied to any other Commitment under such Facility; or

part 1 of schedule 13 (Forms of Notifiable Debt Purchase Transaction Notice).

(d) A Lender shall promptly notify the Facility Agent if a Notifiable Debt Purchase
Transaction to which it is a party:

such notification to be substantially in the form set out in part 2 of schedule 13
(Forms of Notifiable Debt Purchase Transaction Notice).

(e) Each Sponsor Affiliate or Borrower that is a Lender agrees that:

(i) in relation to any meeting or conference call to which all the Lenders are
invited to attend or participate, it shall not attend or participate in the same

either case, the Facility Agent otherwise agrees; and

(ii) in its capacity as Lender, unless the Facility Agent otherwise agrees, it shall
not be entitled to receive any report or other document prepared at the behest
of, or on the instructions of, the Facility Agent or one or more of the Lenders.

(a) where that Borrower or Guarantor created Transaction Security over any of its assets
or business in favour of the Security Agent, or Transaction Security in favour of the
Security Agent was created over the shares (or equivalent) of that Borrower or
Guarantor, the Security Agent shall, at the cost and request of the Parent, release
those assets, business or shares (or equivalent) and (where requested to do so by
the Parent) issue certificates of non-crystallisation; and

(c) If the Majority Lenders have not appointed a successor Facility Agent in accordance
with paragraph (b) above within 20 days after notice of resignation was given, the
retiring Facility Agent (after consultation with the Parent) may appoint a successor
Facility Agent (acting through an office in the United Kingdom).

(d) If the Facility Agent wishes to resign because (acting reasonably) it has concluded
that it is no longer appropriate for it to remain as agent and the Facility Agent is
entitled to appoint a successor Facility Agent under paragraph (c) above, the Facility

Agent may (if it concludes (acting reasonably) that it is necessary to do so in order
to persuade the proposed successor Facility Agent to become a party to this
agreement as Facility Agent) agree with the proposed successor Facility Agent
amendments to this clause 32.12 and any other term of this agreement dealing with
the rights or obligations of the Facility Agent consistent with then current market
practice for the appointment and protection of corporate trustees and those
amendments will bind the Parties.

a successor.

fees for the account of the retiring Facility Agent shall cease to accrue from (and
shall be payable on) that date). Any successor and each of the other Parties shall
have the same rights and obligations amongst themselves as they would have had

extent applicable, shall use reasonable endeavours to appoint a successor Facility
Agent pursuant to paragraph (c) above) if on or after the date which is three months
before the earliest FATCA Application Date relating to any payment to the Facility
Agent under the Finance Documents, either:

(i) the Facility Agent fails to respond to a request under clause 18.8 (FATCA
information) and the Parent or a Lender reasonably believes that the Facility
Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after
that FATCA Application Date;

(ii) the information supplied by the Facility Agent pursuant to clause 18.8 (FATCA
information) indicates that the Facility Agent will not be (or will have ceased

will not be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that
FATCA Application Date;

and (in each case) the Parent or a Lender reasonably believes that a Party will be
required to make a FATCA Deduction that would not be required if the Facility Agent
were a FATCA Exempt Party, and the Parent or that Lender, by notice to the Facility
Agent, requires it to resign.

32.13 Replacement of the Facility Agent

(a) After consultation with the Parent, the Majority Lenders may, by giving 30 days'

by giving any shorter notice determined by the Majority Lenders) replace the Facility
Agent by appointing a successor Facility Agent (acting through an office in the United
Kingdom).

Facility Agent may reasonably request for the purposes of performing its functions
as Facility Agent under the Finance Documents.

Facility Agent) and this clause 32 (and any agency fees for the account of the retiring
Facility Agent shall cease to accrue from (and shall be payable on) that date).

may be treated as confidential to that division or department and the Facility Agent
shall not be deemed to have notice of it.

32.15 Relationship with the Lenders

(a) Subject to clause 29.14 (Pro rata interest settlement), the Facility Agent may treat
the person shown in its records as Lender at the opening of business (in the place of
the Facility Agent's principal office as notified to the Finance Parties from time to
time) as the Lender acting through its Facility Office:

(i) entitled to or liable for any payment due under any Finance Document on that
day; and

(ii) entitled to receive and act upon any notice, request, document or
communication or make any decision or determination under any Finance
Document made or delivered on that day,

electronic means is permitted under clause 37.6 (Electronic communication))
electronic mail address and/or any other information required to enable the
transmission of information by that means (and, in each case, the department or
officer, if any, for whose attention communication is to be made) and be treated as
a notification of a substitute address, fax number, electronic mail address (or such
other information), department and officer by that Lender for the purposes of
clause 37.2 (Addresses) and paragraph (a)(i) of clause 37.6 (Electronic

to a payment due under the Finance Documents then:

(i) the Recovering Finance Party shall, within three Business Days, notify details
of the receipt or recovery, to the Facility Agent;

(ii) the Facility Agent shall determine whether the receipt or recovery is in excess
of the amount the Recovering Finance Party would have been paid had the
receipt or recovery been received or made by the Facility Agent and
distributed in accordance with clause 35 (Payment mechanics), without taking
account of any Tax which would be imposed on the Facility Agent in relation
to the receipt, recovery or distribution; and

(iii) the Recovering Finance Party shall, within three Business Days of demand by
the Facility Agent, pay to the Facility Agent an amount (the "Sharing
Payment") equal to such receipt or recovery less any amount which the
Facility Agent determines may be retained by the Recovering Finance Party
as its share of any payment to be made, in accordance with clause 35.6
(Partial payments).

227
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

(b) Paragraph (a) above shall not apply to any amount received or recovered by an
Ancillary Lender in respect of any cash cover provided for the benefit of that Ancillary
Lender.

Obligor and distribute it between the Finance Parties (other than the Recovering Finance
Party) (the "Sharing Finance Parties") in accordance with clause 35.6 (Partial payments)
towards the obligations of that Obligor to the Sharing Finance Parties.

34.3 Recovering Finance Party's rights

On a distribution by the Facility Agent under clause 34.2 (Redistribution of payments) of a
payment received by a Recovering Finance Party from an Obligor, as between the relevant

the Sharing Payment will be treated as not having been paid by that Obligor.

34.4 Reversal of redistribution

If any part of the Sharing Payment received or recovered by a Recovering Finance Party
becomes repayable and is repaid by that Recovering Finance Party, then:

(a) each Sharing Finance Party shall, upon request of the Facility Agent, pay to the
Facility Agent for the account of that Recovering Finance Party an amount equal to
the appropriate part of its share of the Sharing Payment (together with an amount
as is necessary to reimburse that Recovering Finance Party for its proportion of any
interest on the Sharing Payment which that Recovering Finance Party is required to
pay) (the "Redistributed Amount"); and

(b) as between the relevant Obligor and each relevant Sharing Finance Party, an amount
equal to the relevant Redistributed Amount will be treated as not having been paid
by that Obligor.

not, after making any payment pursuant to this clause 34, have a valid and
enforceable claim against the relevant Obligor.

(b) A Recovering Finance Party is not obliged to share with any other Finance Party any
amount which the Recovering Finance Party has received or recovered as a result of
taking legal or arbitration proceedings, if:

(i) it notified the other Finance Party of the legal or arbitration proceedings; and

35. PAYMENT MECHANICS

35.1 Payments to the Facility Agent

(a) On each date on which an Obligor or a Lender is required to make a payment under
a Finance Document, excluding a payment under the terms of an Ancillary Document,
that Obligor or Lender shall make the same available to the Facility Agent (unless a
contrary indication appears in a Finance Document) for value on the due date at the
time and in such funds specified by the Facility Agent as being customary at the time
for settlement of transactions in the relevant currency in the place of payment.

(b) Payment shall be made to such account in the principal financial centre of the country
of that currency (or, in relation to euro, in a principal financial centre in such
Participating Member State or London, as specified by the Facility Agent) and with
such bank as the Facility Agent, in each case, specifies.

35.2 Distributions by the Facility Agent

Each payment received by the Facility Agent under the Finance Documents for another Party
shall, subject to clause 35.3 (Distributions to an Obligor) and clause 35.4 (Clawback and
pre-funding) be made available by the Facility Agent as soon as reasonably practicable after
receipt to the Party entitled to receive payment in accordance with this agreement (in the
case of a Lender, for the account of its Facility Office), to such account as that Party may
notify to the Facility Agent by not less than five Business Days' notice, or in the case of a
Borrower, such shorter period as is contemplated by clause 5.1 (Delivery of a Utilisation
Request), with a bank specified by that Party in the principal financial centre of the country
of that currency (or, in relation to euro, in the principal financial centre of a Participating
Member State or London, as specified by that Party) or, in the case of a Borrower, to such
account as it may notify to the Facility Agent in accordance with clause 5.1 (Delivery of a
Utilisation Request).

35.3 Distributions to an Obligor

The Facility Agent may (with the consent of the Obligor or in accordance with clause 36
(Set-off)) apply any amount received by it for that Obligor in or towards payment (on the

the Finance Documents or in or towards purchase of any amount of any currency to be so
applied.

35.4 Clawback and pre-funding

(a) Where a sum is to be paid to the Facility Agent under the Finance Documents for

(or to enter into or perform any related exchange contract) until it has been able to
establish to its satisfaction that it has actually received that sum.

(b) Unless paragraph (c) below applies, if the Facility Agent pays an amount to another
Party and it proves to be the case that the Facility Agent had not actually received
that amount, then the Party to whom that amount (or the proceeds of any related
exchange contract) was paid by the Facility Agent shall on demand refund the same
to the Facility Agent together with interest on that amount from the date of payment
to the date of receipt by the Facility Agent, calculated by the Facility Agent to reflect
its cost of funds.

229
EUS\HCB\400080815 15


-----

(c) If the Facility Agent has notified the Lenders that it is willing to make available
amounts for the account of a Borrower before receiving funds from the Lenders then
if and to the extent that the Facility Agent does so but it proves to be the case that
it does not then receive funds from a Lender in respect of a sum which it paid to a
Borrower:

(i) the Facility Agent shall notify the Parent of that Lender's identity and the
Borrower to whom that sum was made available shall on demand refund it to
the Facility Agent; and

(ii) the Lender by whom those funds should have been made available or, if that
Lender fails to do so, the Borrower to whom that sum was made available,
shall on demand pay to the Facility Agent the amount (as certified by the
Facility Agent) which will indemnify the Facility Agent against any funding cost
incurred by it as a result of paying out that sum before receiving those funds
from that Lender.

35.5 Impaired Agent

(a) If, at any time, the Facility Agent becomes an Impaired Agent, an Obligor or a Lender
which is required to make a payment under the Finance Documents to the Facility
Agent in accordance with clause 35.1 (Payments to the Facility Agent) may instead
either:

(i) pay that amount direct to the required recipient(s); or

(ii) if in its absolute discretion it considers that it is not reasonably practicable to
pay that amount direct to the required recipient(s), pay that amount or the
relevant part of that amount to an interest-bearing account held with an
Acceptable Bank within the meaning of paragraph (a) of the definition of
"Acceptable Bank" and in relation to which no Insolvency Event has occurred
and is continuing, in the name of the Obligor or the Lender making the
payment (the "Paying Party") and designated as a trust account for the
benefit of the Party or Parties beneficially entitled to that payment under the
Finance Documents (the "Recipient Party" or "Recipient Parties").

In each case such payments must be made on the due date for payment under the
Finance Documents.

(b) All interest accrued on the amount standing to the credit of the trust account shall
be for the benefit of the Recipient Party or the Recipient Parties pro rata to their
respective entitlements.

clause 32.13 (Replacement of the Facility Agent), each Paying Party shall (other than
to the extent that that Party has given an instruction pursuant to paragraph (e)
below) give all requisite instructions to the bank with whom the trust account is held
to transfer the amount (together with any accrued interest) to the successor Facility
Agent for distribution to the relevant Recipient Party or Recipient Parties in
accordance with clause 35.2 (Distributions by the Facility Agent).

(e) A Paying Party shall, promptly upon request by a Recipient Party and to the extent:

(i) that it has not given an instruction pursuant to paragraph (d) above; and

230

Party.

35.6 Partial payments

respect of any Finance Documents that is insufficient to discharge all the amounts
then due and payable by an Obligor under those Finance Documents, the Facility
Agent shall apply that payment towards the obligations of that Obligor under the
Finance Documents in the following order:

Facility Agent or the Security Agent under the Finance Documents;

(ii) secondly, in or towards payment pro rata of any accrued interest, fee or
commission due but unpaid under those Finance Documents;

as provided under paragraph (b) of clause 9.2 (Repayment of Revolving Facility Loans)).

35.8 Business Days

(a) Any payment under the Finance Documents which is due to be made on a day that
is not a Business Day shall be made on the next Business Day in the same calendar
month (if there is one) or the preceding Business Day (if there is not).

under this agreement interest is payable on the principal or Unpaid Sum at the rate
payable on the original due date.

and market practice in the Relevant Market and otherwise to reflect the change in
currency.

If either the Facility Agent determines (in its discretion) that a Disruption Event has occurred
or the Facility Agent is notified by the Parent that a Disruption Event has occurred:

administration of the Facilities as the Facility Agent may deem necessary in the
circumstances;

SCHEDULE 11

Agreed Security Principles

1. CONSIDERATIONS

1.1 In determining what security or guarantees ("Security") will be provided in support of the
Facilities the following matters will be taken into account. Security shall not be created or
perfected to the extent that it would:

(a) result in any breach of corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference
or thin capitalisation laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable
jurisdiction;

(b) result in a significant risk to any directors or officers of the relevant grantor of
Security or contravention of their fiduciary duties and/or of civil or criminal or
personal liability;

(c) interfere unreasonably with the ordinary course of operations of the grantor of the
Security; or

(d) result in costs that are unreasonable in all the circumstances or disproportionate to
the benefit obtained by the beneficiaries of that Security.

1.2 For the avoidance of doubt, in these Agreed Security Principles, "cost" includes, but is not
limited to, income tax cost, registration taxes payable on the creation or enforcement or for
the continuance of any Security, stamp duties, notarisation fees, legal fees, out-of-pocket
expenses, and other fees and expenses directly incurred by the relevant grantor of Security
or any of its direct or indirect owners, subsidiaries or Affiliates.

2. OBLIGATIONS TO BE SECURED

2.1 Subject to paragraph 1 (Considerations) above and sub-paragraph 2.3 below, the
obligations to be secured are the Secured Obligations (as defined below). The Transaction
Security is to be granted in favour of the Security Agent on behalf of each Lender from time
to time, and the Facility Agent, the Arranger and any Hedge Counterparty.

2.2 For ease of reference, the following definitions should, to the extent legally possible, be
incorporated into each Transaction Security Document (with the capitalised terms used in
them having the meaning given to them in the Intercreditor Agreement):

"Secured Obligations" means all the Liabilities and all other present and future liabilities
and obligations at any time due, owing or incurred by any member of the Group and by
each Debtor to any Secured Party under the Debt Documents, both actual and contingent
and whether incurred solely or jointly and as principal or surety or in any other capacity;
and

"Secured Parties" means the Security Agent, any Receiver or Delegate and each of the

3.2 The parties to this agreement agree to negotiate the form of each Transaction Security

3.3 The first draft of each Transaction Security Document prepared by the Secured Parties'
counsel shall reflect these Agreed Security Principles.

3.4 The form of guarantee is set out in clause 23 (Guarantee and indemnity) of this agreement
and, with respect to any Additional Guarantor, is subject to any limitations set out in the
Accession Deed applicable to such Additional Guarantor.

3.5 The Security shall, to the extent possible under local law, be enforceable following the
occurrence of a Declared Default.

3.6 It shall not be necessary for an Excluded Entity to become an Additional Guarantor or grant
Transaction Security.

International Limited, it shall not be necessary for CareTech International Limited to grant

"Excluded Entity" means any member of the Group that is incorporated in an Excluded
Jurisdiction; and

"Excluded Jurisdiction" means the United Arab Emirates.

4. SHARES

4.1 Any share security will provide that, until a notice has been served by the Facility Agent in
accordance with clause 28.18 (Acceleration) or clause 28.19 (Super Senior Acceleration),
the grantor of the Security will be entitled to:

(a) receive dividends unless the payment of those dividends is otherwise prohibited by
this agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(b) exercise voting rights, unless the exercise of those rights is reasonably likely to be
materially prejudicial to the validity or enforceability of the security created or cause
an Event of Default to occur.

4.2 After a notice has been served by the Facility Agent in accordance with clause 28.18
(Acceleration) or clause 28.19 (Super Senior Acceleration), the voting and dividend receipt
rights may only be exercised by the Security Agent.

of such security will use all reasonable endeavours to obtain any necessary consent from
the freeholder, superior leaseholder or any other third party.

5.3 There shall be no requirement to investigate title or provide surveys or other due diligence
unless it is either material freehold property with a value exceeding £5,000,000 (or its
