Election Date as the date of determination of compliance, as provided above, (x)
if any such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such
basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in Consolidated _Pro Forma_
EBITDA) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the
consummation of the relevant Limited Condition Transaction, such baskets or
ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations
solely for the purposes of determining whether the Limited Condition
Transaction and the related transactions are permitted hereunder and (y) such
baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such Limited
Condition Transaction or related transactions.

(b) Without limitation to the provisions relating to a Limited Condition Transaction,
when establishing whether any action, transaction and/or incurrence of a
liability is permitted under the terms of the Finance Documents, the Group shall
be entitled to rely on the fact that such action, transaction and/or incurrence was
permitted at the time that action was originally taken, that transaction was
originally committed to or that liability was originally incurred (as the case may
be) and, in respect of any acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture,
investment or other similar transaction where there is a time difference between
commitment and closing or incurrence (including, without limitation, in respect
of the incurrence of Financial Indebtedness, the making of any Permitted
Payment and/or any Permitted Acquisition) the relevant member of the Group
may elect to test any permissibility under any covenant or permission in the
Finance Documents (including any baskets, ratios and other exceptions and
whether a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and any representations
and warranties required to be given) as at the date of entry into a binding
commitment (rather than closing or incurrence) for such relevant transaction.

1.4 **Currency Symbols and Definitions**

(a) “£”, “Sterling” and “GBP” mean the lawful currency for the time being of the
United Kingdom.

(b) “€”, “euro” and “EUR” mean the single currency unit of the Participating
Member State.

(c) “$”, “US$” and “US Dollars” mean the lawful currency for the time being of
the United States of America.

1.5 **Other applicable jurisdictions**

(a) Any principles of construction set out in an Accession Deed and agreed with
the Agent (acting reasonably) shall apply to this Agreement as if set out this
Agreement.

(b) If any member of the Group that is established or tax resident in a jurisdiction
other than Guernsey or the United Kingdom becomes an Additional Borrower,
any additional customary Tax provisions shall (subject to agreement by the
Agent, acting reasonably) be set out in the relevant Accession Deed, including


-----

any consequential adjustments to representations to be made by that member of
the Group.

1.6 **Exchange rate fluctuations**

(a) When applying any monetary limits, thresholds and other exceptions to the
representations and warranties, undertakings and Events of Defaults under the
Finance Documents, the equivalent to an amount in GBP shall be calculated at
the rate for the conversion of GBP into the relevant currency of the non-GBP
monetary limit, threshold and other exception:

(i) as existing as at the Closing Date;

(ii) which the Company (acting reasonably and in good faith) has used and
has notified to the Agent;

(iii) at the option of the Company, if hedged, the hedged rate or at the
Agent’s Spot Rate of Exchange; or

(iv) in each case, as at the date of the Group incurring or making the relevant
disposal, acquisition, investment, lease, loan, debt or guarantee or taking
any other relevant action. For the avoidance of doubt, this Clause 1.6
shall not apply to paragraph (d) of Clause 24.3 (Calculations).

(b) No Default, Event of Default or breach of any representation and warranty or
undertaking under the Finance Documents shall arise merely as a result of a
subsequent change in the Base Currency equivalent or any other currency
equivalent specified for any basket, monetary limit, threshold or other exception
due to fluctuations in exchange rates.

1.7 **Baskets**

(a) Any amounts incurred on the basis of any basket, test or permission where an
element is set by reference to a percentage of Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA
(an “EBITDA based basket”) shall (provided that such amounts are, at the
time of incurrence, duly and properly incurred in accordance with the relevant
basket, test or permission) be treated as having been duly and properly incurred
without the incurrence of an Event of Default even in the event that such
EBITDA based basket subsequently decreases by virtue of operation of that
calculation.

(b) In the event that any amount or transaction meets the criteria of more than one
of the baskets or exceptions set out in this Agreement, the Obligors’ Agent, in
its sole discretion, will classify and may from time to time reclassify that amount
or transaction to a particular basket or exception and will only be required to
include that amount or transaction in one of those baskets or exceptions (and an
amount or transaction may at the option of the Obligors’ Agent be split between
different baskets or exceptions).

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, Super Senior Commitments shall be incurred under
the Super Senior Basket and shall not be reclassified.


-----

(d) Any reference in this Agreement to a Testing Metric shall be deemed to be a
reference to such a Testing Metric as determined at the Applicable Test Date.

(e) For any relevant basket set by reference to a Financial Year or a calendar year
(each an “Annual Period”):

(i) at the option of the Obligors’ Agent, the maximum amount so permitted
under such basket during such Annual Period may be increased by:
(A) an amount equal to 100 per cent. of the difference (if positive)
between the permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual
Period and the amount thereof actually used or applied by the Group
during such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward Amount”);
and/or (B) an amount equal to 100 per cent. of the permitted amount in
the immediately following Annual Period and the permitted amount in
such immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced by such
corresponding amount (the “Carry Back Amount”); and

(ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such basket
during such Annual Period is increased in accordance with paragraph (i)
above, any usage of such basket during such Annual Period shall be
deemed to be applied in the following order: (1) firstly against the Carry
Forward Amount; (2) secondly against the maximum amount so
permitted during such Annual Period prior to any increase in accordance
with paragraph (i) above; and (3) thirdly against the Carry Back Amount.

(f) To the extent that any Additional Facility or Permitted Financial Indebtedness
satisfies any Testing Metric or other condition (pro forma its incurrence) on the
Applicable Test Date, for the avoidance of doubt, such condition is deemed to
have been satisfied, including on the date of its incurrence and irrespective of
any facts or circumstances (including financial condition) thereafter.

1.8 **Non-wholly-owned Subsidiaries**

Where any person (the “first person”) is required under this Agreement or any other
Finance Document to ensure or procure certain acts, events or circumstances in relation
to any other person (the “second person”) and the first person (together with its
Affiliates) owns less than 50 per cent. plus one share in aggregate of the issued voting
share capital (or instruments providing equivalent control) in the second person, the
first person shall only be obliged to use its reasonable efforts, subject to all limitations
and restrictions on the influence it may exercise as a shareholder over the second
person, pursuant to any agreement with the other shareholders or pursuant to any
applicable law which requires the consent of the other shareholders, and its obligation
to ensure or procure shall not be construed as a guarantee for such acts, events or
circumstances.

1.9 **Third Party Rights**

(a) A person who is not a Party has no right under the Contracts (Rights of Third
Parties) Act 1999 (the “Third Parties Act”) to enforce or enjoy the benefit of
any term of this Agreement.


-----

(b) Notwithstanding any term of any Finance Document, the consent of any person
who is not a Party is not required to rescind or vary this Agreement at any time.

1.10 **Intercreditor Agreement**

This Agreement is subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of any
inconsistency between this Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Intercreditor Agreement shall prevail.

1.11 **No Investor Recourse**

No Finance Party will have any recourse to any Investor that is not party to a Finance
Document (and to the extent an Investor is a party to a Finance Document there shall
only be recourse to the extent of its liability under the terms of such Finance Document)
in respect of any term of any Finance Document, any statements by Investors, or
otherwise.

1.12 **Personal Liability**

Where any natural person gives a certificate or other document or otherwise gives a
representation or statement on behalf of any of the parties to the Finance Documents
pursuant to any provision thereof and such certificate or other document, representation
or statement proves to be incorrect, the individual shall incur no personal liability in
consequence of such certificate, other document, representation or statement being
incorrect save where such individual acted fraudulently in giving such certificate, other
document, representation or statement (in which case any liability of such individual
shall be determined in accordance with applicable law), and each such individual may
rely on this Clause 1.12, subject to Clause 1.9 (Third Party Rights) and the provisions
of the Third Parties Act.

1.13 **Cashless**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any other
Finance Document, to the extent that any Lender extends the maturity date of, or
replaces, renews or refinances, any of its then-existing Loans with Additional Facility
Loans or loans in connection with any loans incurred or to be incurred under a new
credit facility as a result of a Permitted Structural Adjustment, in each case, that are
effected by means of a “cashless roll” by such Lender, such extension, replacement,
renewal or refinancing shall be deemed to comply with any requirement under this
Agreement or any other Finance Document for such payment to be made in the
applicable currency, amount and form (including “in immediately available funds” or
“in cash”) or any other similar requirement.

1.14 **IFRS**

Any lease, concession, licence of property or other arrangement (or guarantee thereof)
which was considered not to be a finance lease prior to the introduction of IFRS 16
(Leases) (each an “operating lease”) shall continue to be treated as an operating lease
notwithstanding that it would otherwise be, or required to be, treated as a finance lease
or capital lease under the Accounting Principles following the adoption of IFRS 16
(Leases) or any other change to the treatment of that operating lease under the


-----

Accounting Principles. For the avoidance of doubt, IFRS 16 (Leases) shall at all times
and notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement be applied on a consistent
basis for the purposes of calculating Consolidated Total Net Debt and Consolidated
EBITDA, in each case, under the Finance Documents.

1.15 **Guernsey Terms**

In each Finance Document, where it relates to a person (i) incorporated, (ii) established,

of en désastre being made in respect of any such entity or any of its assets (or
the making of such declaration).

2. **THE FACILITIES**

2.1 **The Facilities**

(a) Subject to this Clause 2.2, the Obligors’ Agent may, at any time and from time
to time following the Closing Date, by delivering to the Agent a duly completed
Additional Facility Notice complying with paragraph (b) below establish an
Additional Facility or Additional Facilities.

(b) No consent of any Finance Party is required to establish an Additional Facility
at any time (other than, in relation to an Additional Facility, the relevant
Additional Facility Lenders) **provided that (unless otherwise agreed by the**
Majority Lenders) each of the following applicable conditions is met:

(i) in relation to an Additional Facility which is an Eligible Facility and
which is funded within 36 Months of the Closing Date, the All-in Yield
of that Additional Facility shall not exceed the All-in Yield applicable
to Facility B (calculated at its highest rate) by more than 0.75 per cent.
per annum (the “MFN Rate”) unless the All-in Yield in relation to
Facility B is increased by an amount by which the All-in Yield for such
Additional Facility exceeds the MFN Rate;

(ii) an Additional Term Facility ranks pari passu with Facility B and shall
be entitled to benefit from any or all Transaction Security (subject to the
Agreed Security Principles) (in each case, on terms agreed by each
relevant Borrower and each Additional Facility Lender under that

Intercreditor Agreement) or any other Security **provided that such**
Security is simultaneously offered to all the Lenders;

(iii) an Additional Revolving Facility ranks super senior to Facility B and
shall be entitled to benefit from any or all Transaction Security (subject
to the Agreed Security Principles) (in each case, on terms agreed by each
relevant Borrower and each Additional Facility Lender under that
Additional Facility from time to time and subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement) or any other Security **provided that such**
Security is simultaneously offered to all the Lenders;


-----

(iv) neither (A) the Termination Date; nor (B) any amortisation date, for an
Additional Term Facility may fall prior to the original final scheduled
maturity date for Facility B (unless, in each case, the Facility B

the date falling 3 Business Days after the incurrence of such Additional
Term Facility) **provided that nothing in this paragraph (iv) shall**
prohibit any Additional Term Facility from amortising at a rate not
exceeding 1.00 per cent. of the original principal amount of the relevant
Additional Term Facility in aggregate per annum, unless all the Lenders
under Facility B at such time have also accepted an offer by the Obligors’
Agent of an amortisation repayment per annum for each corresponding
year in a number of basis points per annum equal to the amortisation
repayment of such amortising Additional Term Facility in excess of 1.00
per cent., provided that, for the purposes of this paragraph (iv), each
individual Lender under Facility B at such time will be deemed to have
rejected such offer unless such Lender notifies the Agent that it has
accepted such offer by 11:00 a.m. five Business Days (or such longer
period as the Obligors’ Agent agrees) after the date of such offer;

(v) the Termination Date for an Additional Revolving Facility shall not fall

allocate participations in the Additional Facility to any bank or financial
institution (including a trust) or to any fund or vehicle or other entity which is
engaged in or established for the purpose of making, purchasing or investing in
loans, securities and/or other financial assets.

(d) If any proposed Additional Facility Lender is not an existing Lender, that
proposed Additional Facility Lender shall be required (and shall, subject to
Clause 27 (Changes to the Lenders), be entitled) to accede to this Agreement in
accordance with Clause 27 (Changes to the Lenders), and (i) any Additional
Facility shall form part of the Facilities, (ii) any providers of any Additional
Facility shall be entitled to the benefit of the guarantees and Transaction
Security and (iii) any Additional Term Facility shall, in all respects, rank pari
_passu with the Facilities in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor_
Agreement.

(e) The opportunity to provide (i) an Additional Term Facility must first be given
to all of the Original Lenders under the Term Facilities and (ii) an Additional
Revolving Facility must first be given to all of the Original Lenders under the
Revolving Facilities, in each case, on a pro rata basis in accordance with their
respective Commitments at that time and such offer shall be open to acceptance


-----

by such Original Lenders. Following receipt of a request from the Obligors’
Agent to provide such an Additional Facility, each relevant Original Lender
shall have the right, but not the obligation, within 15 Business Days (the “Initial
**Period”), to accept the Obligors’ Agent’s offer and agree to provide up to its**
_pro rata amount of the requested Additional Facility. If one or more of the_
relevant Original Lenders confirms that it is not willing to provide its pro rata
amount of the requested Additional Facility on the terms requested by the
Obligors’ Agent, or fails to respond to the Obligors’ Agent, in each case by the
end of the Initial Period, then the Obligors’ Agent may offer the amount not
accepted to another bank, financial institution, trust, fund, entity or other person
selected by the Obligors’ Agent.

(f) [Reserved]

(g) The Additional Facility Notice shall not be regarded as having been duly

Facility;

(ii) the person(s) to become Additional Facility Lenders in respect of the
Additional Facility and the amount of the Commitments of such
Additional Facility allocated to each Additional Facility Lender;

(iii) the aggregate amount of the Commitments of the Additional Facility and
the currency being made available and any Optional Currency or
Currencies which are available for utilisation under the Additional
Facility;

(iv) the rate of interest applicable to the Additional Facility (including any
applicable margin, basis and/or margin ratchet);

(v) the Additional Facility Commencement Date and Availability Period for
the Additional Facility;

(vi) the Termination Date, amortisation schedule and any mandatory
prepayment provisions;

(vii) any other specification (including, if applicable, if the Additional
Facility is made on a certain funds basis);

(viii) that the Additional Facility does not cause the Permitted Indebtedness
Cap to be exceeded;

(ix) [Reserved]; and

(x) without prejudice to paragraph (viii) above, if the Additional Facility is
a Super Senior Facility, the Super Senior Commitments subject to such
Additional Facility Notice do not cause the amount permitted to be
incurred pursuant to the Super Senior Basket to be exceeded,


-----

and such Additional Facility Notice shall be deemed to have been duly
completed if it is signed by each party thereto.

(h) Subject to the conditions set out in this Clause 2.2 being satisfied, following
receipt by the Agent of a duly completed Additional Facility Notice and with
effect from the relevant Additional Facility Commencement Date (or any later
date on which the conditions set out in paragraph (i) below are satisfied) the
relevant Additional Facility shall come into effect and be established in
accordance with its terms and:

(i) the Additional Facility Lenders participating in the relevant Additional
Facility shall make available that Additional Facility in the aggregate
amount set out in the Additional Facility Notice;

(ii) each of the Obligors and each Additional Facility Lender shall assume
such obligations towards one another and/or acquire such rights against
one another as the Obligors and such Additional Facility Lenders would
have assumed and/or acquired had the Additional Facility Lenders been
Original Lenders;

(iii) in relation to an Additional Facility Lender which is not already a Lender,
each Additional Facility Lender under the relevant Additional Facility
shall become a Party to this Agreement as a Lender;

(iv) each Additional Facility Lender under the relevant Additional Facility
and each of the other Finance Parties shall assume such obligations
towards one another and acquire such rights against one another as those
Additional Facility Lenders and those Finance Parties would have
assumed and/or acquired had the Additional Facility Lenders been
Original Lenders in respect of the relevant Additional Facility; and

(v) the Commitments of the other Lenders shall continue in full force and
effect.

(i) The establishment of an Additional Facility will only be effective on:

(i) the execution of the Additional Facility Notice relating to such
Additional Facility by the Obligors’ Agent, the relevant Borrower(s) and
the relevant Additional Facility Lender(s) and delivery of such executed
notice to the Agent;

(ii) in relation to an Additional Facility Lender which is not already a Lender,
receipt by the Agent of an Additional Facility Lender Accession Notice
from each person referred to in the relevant Additional Facility Notice
as an Additional Facility Lender; and

(iii) in relation to an Additional Facility Lender which is not already a Lender,
the performance by the Agent of all necessary “know your customer” or
other similar identification checks under all applicable laws and
regulations in relation to that Additional Facility Lender making


-----

available an Additional Facility, the completion of which the Agent shall
promptly notify to the Obligors’ Agent.

(j) Each Obligor irrevocably authorises the Obligors’ Agent to sign each
Additional Facility Notice on its behalf and each Finance Party irrevocably
authorises and instructs:

(i) the Agent to acknowledge, execute and confirm acceptance of each
Additional Facility Notice; and

(ii) the Agent and the Security Agent to acknowledge, execute and confirm
acceptance of each Additional Facility Lender Accession Notice, the
documentation required for the Additional Facility Lender to accede to
the Intercreditor Agreement (in each case, if applicable) and to execute
any necessary amendments, confirmation, supplements revisions or
releases to any Finance Document as may be required in order to ensure
that any Additional Facility ranks in accordance with the provisions set
out in the Additional Facility Notice.

(k) The Agent and/or the Security Agent shall as soon as reasonably practicable
send to the Obligors’ Agent a copy of each executed Additional Facility Notice
and, if applicable, Additional Facility Lender Accession Notice and, if
applicable, the documentation required for the Additional Facility Lender to
accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.

(l) Except to the extent as provided in paragraph (b) above, the terms applicable to
any Additional Facility will be those agreed by the Additional Facility Lenders
in respect of that Additional Facility and the Obligors’ Agent. If there is any
inconsistency between any such term agreed in respect of an Additional Facility
and any term of a Finance Document, the term agreed in respect of the
Additional Facility shall prevail with respect to such Additional Facility (subject
to the conditions in paragraph (b) above).

(m) Each Additional Facility Lender, by executing the relevant Additional Facility
Notice confirms (for the avoidance of doubt) that the Agent has authority to
execute on its behalf any consent, release, waiver or amendment that has been
approved by or on behalf of the requisite Lender or Lenders in accordance with
this Agreement on or prior to the date on which the relevant Additional Facility
becomes effective and that it is bound by that decision and by the operations of
any other provisions of this Agreement in relation to such consent, release,
waiver or amendment.

(n) No Lender will have any obligation to participate in an Additional Facility
(unless it has executed and delivered an Additional Facility Lender Accession
Notice or otherwise become an Additional Facility Lender in respect of that
Additional Facility). By signing an Additional Facility Notice as an Additional
Facility Lender, each such entity agrees to commit the Additional Facility
Commitments set out against its name in that Additional Facility Notice.

(o) The Agent may (after consultation with the Company) disclose the terms of any
Additional Facility Notice to any of the other Finance Parties provided that the


-----

Agent shall not disclose any terms which are identified by the Obligors’ Agent
as being commercially sensitive, confidential or subject to limitations on
disclosure pursuant to or in connection with any law, regulation, investigation,
procedure or judgment.

(p) Clause 27.6 (Limitation of responsibility of Existing Lenders) shall apply
_mutatis mutandis in this Clause 2.2 in relation to an Additional Facility Lender_
as if references in that Clause to:

(i) an Existing Lender were references to all the Lenders immediately prior
to the establishment of the relevant Additional Facility;

(ii) the New Lender were references to that Additional Facility Lender; and

(iii) a re-transfer and re-assignment were references to respectively a transfer
and assignment.

(q) The Obligors’ Agent may pay to an Additional Facility Lender a fee in the
amount and at the times agreed between the Company and the Additional
Facility Lender in a Fee Letter.

(r) The establishment, terms or conditions or use of proceeds of any Additional
Facility shall be governed by this Clause 2.2 and paragraph (d) of Clause 3.1
(Purpose) which, in each case, shall apply irrespective and notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement (including Clause 9 (Illegality, Voluntary
_Prepayment and Cancellation), Clause 33.6 (Partial payments) and Clause 39_
(Amendments and Waivers) and Schedule 11 (Form of Increase Confirmation))
and whether such Additional Facility is in place prior to the Additional Facility
Commencement Date for the purposes of this Agreement.

(s) Each Obligor confirms:

(i) the authority of the Obligors’ Agent to agree and implement the
establishment of an Additional Facility under this Clause 2.2;

(ii) that its guarantees and indemnity obligations under the Finance
Documents extend to and include any Additional Facility implemented
and established under this Clause 2.2 (including any other obligations
arising under such Additional Facility); and

(iii) that it will take all necessary steps to ensure that the Facilities (including
any Additional Facility) benefit from the Transaction Security (subject
to the Agreed Security Principles and in accordance with Clause 25.27
(Further assurance)).


-----

(a) The Obligors’ Agent may by giving prior notice to the Agent by no later than
the date falling 30 Business Days after the effective date of a cancellation of:

(i) the Available Commitments of a Defaulting Lender in accordance with
Clause 9.6 (Right of cancellation in relation to a Defaulting Lender);

(ii) the Commitments of a Lender in accordance with Clause 9.5 (Right of
_cancellation and repayment in relation to a single Lender); or_

(iii) the Commitments of a Lender in accordance with Clause 9.1 (Illegality),

request that the Total Commitments be increased (and the Total Commitments
under that Facility shall be so increased) in an aggregate amount in the Base
Currency of up to the amount of the Available Commitments or Commitments
so cancelled as follows:

(A) the increased Commitments will be assumed by one or more
Lenders or other banks, financial institutions, trusts, funds or
other entities (each an “Increase Lender”) selected by the
Company (each of which shall not be a Sponsor Affiliate or a
member of the Group, and which satisfies all the Agent’s “know
your customer” or similar checks referred to in paragraph
(b)(ii)(B) below, and each of which confirms its willingness to
assume and does assume all the obligations of a Lender
corresponding to that part of the increased Commitments which
it is to assume, as if it had been an Original Lender (for the
avoidance of doubt, no Party shall be obliged to assume the
obligations of a Lender pursuant to this Clause 2.3 without the
prior consent of that Party));

assume obligations towards one another and/or acquire rights
against one another as the Parent, Obligors and the Increase
Lender would have assumed and/or acquired had the Increase
Lender been an Original Lender;

(C) each Increase Lender shall become a Party as a “Lender” and
any Increase Lender and each of the other Finance Parties shall
assume obligations towards one another and acquire rights
against one another as that Increase Lender and those Finance
Parties would have assumed and/or acquired had the Increase
Lender been an Original Lender;

(D) the Commitments of the other Lenders shall continue in full
force and effect; and

(E) any increase in the Total Commitments shall take effect on the
date specified by the Company in the notice referred to above or


-----

any later date on which the conditions set out in paragraph (b)
below are satisfied.

(b) An increase in the Total Commitments will only be effective on:

(i) the execution by the Agent of an Increase Confirmation from the
relevant Increase Lender; and

(ii) in relation to an Increase Lender which is not a Lender immediately prior
to the relevant increase:

(A) the Increase Lender entering into the documentation required for
it to accede as a party to the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) the performance by the Agent of all necessary “know your
customer” or other similar checks under all applicable laws and
regulations in relation to the assumption of the increased
Commitments by that Increase Lender, the completion of which
the Agent shall promptly notify to the Company and the Increase
Lender.

(c) Each Increase Lender, by executing the Increase Confirmation, confirms (for
the avoidance of doubt) that the Agent has authority to execute on its behalf any
amendment or waiver that has been approved by or on behalf of the requisite
Lender or Lenders in accordance with this Agreement on or prior to the date on
which the increase becomes effective.

(d) Unless the Agent otherwise agrees or the increased Commitment is assumed by
an existing Lender, the Company shall, on the date upon which the increase
takes effect, pay to the Agent (for its own account) a fee of £2,500 and the
Company shall within five Business Days of demand pay to the Agent and the
Security Agent the amount of all third party costs and expenses (including legal
fees) reasonably and properly incurred by either of them (and/or any Receiver
or Delegate) in connection with any increased Commitments under this Clause
2.3.

(e) The Obligors’ Agent may pay to the Increase Lender a fee in the amount and at
the times agreed between the Company and the Increase Lender in a Fee Letter.

(f) Clause 27.6 (Limitation of responsibility of Existing Lenders) shall apply
_mutatis mutandis in this Clause 2.3 in relation to an Increase Lender as if_
references in that Clause to:

(i) an “Existing Lender” were references to all the Lenders immediately
prior to the relevant increase;

(ii) the “New Lender” were references to that “Increase Lender”; and

(iii) a re-transfer and re assignment were references to respectively a transfer
and assignment.


-----

2.4 **Finance Parties’ rights and obligations**

(a) The obligations of each Finance Party under the Finance Documents are several.
Failure by a Finance Party to perform its obligations under the Finance
Documents does not affect the obligations of any other Party under the Finance
Documents. No Finance Party is responsible for the obligations of any other
Finance Party under the Finance Documents.

(b) The rights of each Finance Party under or in connection with the Finance
Documents are separate and independent rights and any debt arising under the

Finance Documents and irrevocably (to the extent permitted by law) authorises:

(i) the Company on its behalf to supply all information concerning itself
contemplated by this Agreement to the Finance Parties and to give all
notices and instructions (including, in the case of a Borrower, Utilisation
Requests), to execute on its behalf any Accession Deed, to make such
agreements and to effect the relevant amendments, supplements and
variations capable of being given, made or effected by any Obligor
and/or the Parent notwithstanding that they may affect the Obligor
and/or the Parent, without further reference to or the consent of that
Obligor and/or the Parent; and

(ii) each Finance Party to give any notice, demand or other communication
to that Obligor and/or the Parent pursuant to the Finance Documents to
the Company,

and in each case the Obligor or, as the case may be, the Parent shall be bound
as though the Obligor or the Parent itself had given the notices and instructions
(including, without limitation, any Utilisation Requests) or executed or made
the agreements or effected the amendments, supplements or variations, or
received the relevant notice, demand or other communication.


-----

(b) Every act, omission, agreement, undertaking, settlement, waiver, amendment,
supplement, variation, notice or other communication given or made by the
Obligors’ Agent or given to the Obligors’ Agent under any Finance Document
on behalf of another Obligor or the Parent or in connection with any Finance
Document (whether or not known to any other Obligor or the Parent and
whether occurring before or after such other Obligor or the Parent became an
Obligor under any Finance Document) shall be binding for all purposes on that
Obligor or, as the case may be, the Parent as if that Obligor or the Parent had
expressly made, given or concurred with it (to the extent permitted by law). In
the event of any conflict between any notices or other communications of the
Obligors’ Agent and any other Obligor or the Parent, those of the Obligors’
Agent shall prevail.

(c) For the purpose of this Clause 2.5, each Obligor and the Parent (to the extent
necessary under applicable law) shall grant a specific power of attorney
(notarised and apostilled) to the Company and comply with any necessary
formalities in connection therewith.

2.6 **Alternative Facility B Lenders**

(a) Each Alternative Facility B Lender may elect (in its sole discretion), by making
available to the Agent (and the Agent may accept) an amount equal to its
Alternative Facility B Lender Proportion of the participation in a Facility B
Loan which the Original Facility B Lender is required to make available
pursuant to Clause 2.1 (The Facilities) (an “Alternative Facility B Lender
**Funded Amount”), to assume a Facility B Commitment in an amount equal to**
that Alternative Facility B Lender Funded Amount (an “Alternative Facility B
**Lender Assumed Commitment”) and to make its participation in a Facility B**
Loan available in an amount equal to that Alternative Facility B Lender Funded
Amount (an “Alternative Facility B Lender Loan Participation”), in each
case, in place of the Original Facility B Lender.

(b) The Agent shall apply the proceeds of each Alternative Facility B Lender
Funded Amount received from an Alternative Facility B Lender which has
made an election under sub-paragraph (a) above (an “Electing Alternative
**Facility B Lender”) as if they had been amounts received from the Original**
Facility B Lender pursuant to Clause 2.1 (The Facilities).

(c) Immediately following receipt by the Company of the proceeds of a Facility B
Loan:

(i) each Alternative Facility B Lender Assumed Commitment shall be
attributed to the relevant Electing Alternative Facility B Lender as if it
had been the Original Facility B Lender in respect of that Alternative
Facility B Lender Assumed Commitment (and shall no longer be a
Facility B Commitment of the Original Facility B Lender); and

(ii) each Electing Alternative Facility B Lender shall assume all of the rights
and obligations as an Original Facility B Lender in respect of the
relevant Alternative Facility B Lender Loan Participation.


-----

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, if an Alternative Facility B Lender has not elected
to fund an Alternative Facility B Lender Funded Amount (and no Facility B
Commitments have been attributed to it in accordance with this Clause 2.6), the
Parties agree that such Alternative Facility B Lender shall not be a Defaulting
Lender.

(e) If:

(i) any Facility B Commitment is attributed to an Electing Alternative
Facility B Lender in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above,
the Original Facility B Lender shall not be required to make its
participation (in an amount equal to the Alternative Facility B Lender
Funded Amount) in the relevant Facility B Loan available; or

(ii) any Facility B Commitment is not attributed to an Alternative Facility B
Lender in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above or funds
have not been received in cash by the Company from (or on behalf of)
any Electing Alternative Facility B Lender on any Utilisation Date, the
Original Facility B Lender shall be required to make its participation in
the relevant Facility B Loan available in accordance with the Facility B
Commitment of the Original Facility B Lender on that Utilisation Date.

7.1 **Type of Facility**

An Ancillary Facility may be by way of any of the following (or any combination of
the following):

(a) an overdraft, cheque clearing, automatic payment or other current account
facility;


-----

(b) a guarantee, bonding or documentary, standby letter of credit facility or similar
instrument;

(g) any other facility or accommodation as may be required or desirable in
connection with the business of the Group and which is agreed by the Company
and the relevant Ancillary Lender.

7.2 **Availability**

(a) If the Obligors’ Agent and a Lender agree and except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, the Lender may provide an Ancillary Facility on a bilateral
basis in place of all or part of that Lender’s unutilised Revolving Facility
Commitment (which shall (except for the purposes of determining any class of
Lenders (including all Lenders) and for Clause 39.4 (Replacement of Finance
_Party)) be reduced by the amount of the Ancillary Commitment under that_
Ancillary Facility).

(b) An Ancillary Facility shall not be made available unless at least five Business
Days prior to the Ancillary Commencement Date for that Ancillary Facility (or
two Business Days if the Ancillary Commencement Date for that Ancillary
Facility is the Closing Date), the Agent has received from the Obligors’ Agent
a notice in writing of the establishment of that Ancillary Facility and specifying:

(i) the Revolving Facility Borrower(s) (or, subject to Clause 7.9 (Affiliates
_of Borrowers), Affiliate(s) of a Revolving Facility Borrower) which may_
use that Ancillary Facility;

(ii) the Ancillary Commencement Date and expiry date of that Ancillary
Facility;

(iii) the type or types of Ancillary Facility to be provided;

(iv) the Ancillary Lender;

(v) the amount of the Ancillary Commitment, the maximum amount of the
Ancillary Facility and, if the Ancillary Facility is an overdraft facility
comprising more than one account its maximum gross amount (that
amount being the “Designated Gross Amount”) and its maximum net
amount (that amount being the “Designated Net Amount”); and

(vi) the currency or currencies of that Ancillary Facility (if not denominated
in the Base Currency),


-----

without prejudice to the rights of the Agent to request any other information
which the Agent may reasonably request in relation to that Ancillary Facility.

(c) The Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Revolving Facility Lender of the
establishment of an Ancillary Facility.

(d) No amendment or waiver of any term of an Ancillary Facility shall require the
consent of any Finance Party other than the relevant Ancillary Lender unless
such amendment or waiver itself relates to or gives rise to a matter which would
require an amendment of or under this Agreement (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, under this Clause 7.2). In such a case, the provisions of this Agreement
with regard to amendments and waivers will apply.

(e) Subject to compliance with paragraph (b) above:

(i) the Lender concerned will become an Ancillary Lender; and

(ii) the Ancillary Facility will be available,

in each case, with effect from the date agreed by the Company and the Ancillary
Lender.

7.3 **Terms of Ancillary Facilities**

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) below, the terms of any Ancillary Facility
will be those agreed by the relevant Ancillary Lender and the Obligors’ Agent.

(b) Those terms:

(i) to the extent relating to the rate of interest, fees and other remuneration
in respect of that Ancillary Facility, must be based upon the normal
market rates and terms at that time of that Ancillary Lender;

(ii) may only allow Revolving Facility Borrowers (or Affiliates of
Revolving Facility Borrowers) to use that Ancillary Facility;

(iii) may not allow the Ancillary Outstandings to exceed the Ancillary
Commitment under that Ancillary Facility;

(iv) may not allow the Ancillary Commitment of a Lender to exceed the
Available Commitment with respect to the relevant Revolving Facility
of that Lender; and

(v) must require that the Ancillary Commitment is reduced to nil, and that
all Ancillary Outstandings are repaid (or cash cover is provided in
respect of all the Ancillary Outstandings) not later than the Termination
Date for the relevant Revolving Facility (or such earlier date as the
relevant Revolving Facility Commitment of the relevant Ancillary
Lender (or its Affiliate) is reduced to zero).

(c) If there is any inconsistency between any term of an Ancillary Facility and any
term of this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail except for (i) Clause 36.3


-----

(Day count convention and interest calculation) which shall not prevail for the
purposes of calculating fees, interest or commission relating to an Ancillary
Facility; (ii) an Ancillary Facility comprising more than one account where the
terms of the Ancillary Documents shall prevail to the extent necessary to permit
the netting of balances on those accounts; and (iii) where the relevant term of
this Agreement would be contrary to, or inconsistent with, the law governing
the relevant Ancillary Document, in which case that term of this Agreement
shall not prevail.

(d) Interest, commission and fees on Ancillary Facilities are dealt with in Clause
15.7 (Interest, commission and fees on Ancillary Facilities).

7.4 **Repayment of Ancillary Facility**

(a) An Ancillary Facility shall cease to be available on the Termination Date in
relation to the relevant Revolving Facility or such earlier date on which its
expiry date occurs or on which it is cancelled in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.

(b) If and to the extent that an Ancillary Facility expires, or is cancelled (in whole
or in part) in accordance with its terms or is otherwise cancelled in accordance
with this Agreement, the Ancillary Commitment of the Ancillary Lender shall
be reduced, and the relevant Revolving Facility Commitment of the relevant
Lender will immediately be increased, accordingly by an amount equal to the
amount of the Ancillary Commitment of that Ancillary Facility (or, if less, that
part of it which has expired or been cancelled).

(c) No Ancillary Lender may demand repayment or prepayment of any amounts or
demand cash cover for any liabilities made available or incurred by it under its
Ancillary Facility (except where the Ancillary Facility is provided on a net limit
basis to the extent required to bring any gross outstanding down to the net limit)
prior to its expiry date unless:

(i) the relevant Total Revolving Facility Commitments have been cancelled
in full, or all outstanding Utilisations under the relevant Revolving
Facility have become due and payable in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, or the Agent has declared all outstanding Utilisations
under the relevant Revolving Facility immediately due and payable, or
the expiry date of the Ancillary Facility occurs; or

(ii) it becomes unlawful in any applicable jurisdiction for the Ancillary
Lender to perform any of its obligations as contemplated by this
Agreement or to fund, issue or maintain its participation in its Ancillary
Facility; or

(iii) the Ancillary Outstandings (if any) under that Ancillary Facility can be
refinanced by a Revolving Facility Utilisation pursuant to which that
Ancillary Outstanding was incurred and the Ancillary Lender gives
sufficient notice to enable such a Revolving Facility Utilisation to be
made to refinance those Ancillary Outstandings.


-----

(d) For the purposes of determining whether or not the Ancillary Outstandings
under an Ancillary Facility mentioned in paragraph (c)(iii) above can be
refinanced by a Utilisation of the Revolving Facility pursuant to which that
Ancillary Outstanding was incurred:

(i) the relevant Revolving Facility Commitment of the Ancillary Lender
will be increased by the amount of its Ancillary Commitment; and

(ii) the Utilisation may (so long as paragraph (c)(i) above does not apply)
be made irrespective of whether an Event of Default is continuing or any
applicable condition precedent is not satisfied (but only to the extent that
the proceeds are applied in refinancing those Ancillary Outstandings)
and irrespective of whether Clause 4.4 (Maximum number of
_Utilisations) or paragraph (a)(iv) of Clause 5.2 (Completion of a_
_Utilisation Request) applies._

(e) On the making of a Utilisation of a Revolving Facility to refinance all or part of
any Ancillary Outstandings:

(i) each Lender will participate in that Utilisation in an amount (as
determined by the Agent) which will result as nearly as possible in the
aggregate amount of its participation in the relevant Revolving Facility
Utilisations then outstanding bearing the same proportion to the
aggregate amount of the relevant Revolving Facility Utilisations then
outstanding as its relevant Revolving Facility Commitment bears to the
relevant Total Revolving Facility Commitments; and

(ii) the relevant Ancillary Facility shall be cancelled to the extent of such
refinancing.

(f) In relation to an Ancillary Facility which comprises an overdraft facility where
a Designated Net Amount has been established, the Ancillary Lender providing
that Ancillary Facility shall only be obliged to take into account for the purposes
of calculating compliance with the Designated Net Amount those credit
balances which it is permitted to take into account by the then current law and
regulations in relation to its reporting of exposures to the applicable regulatory
authorities as netted for capital adequacy purposes.

7.5 **Ancillary Outstandings**

Each Borrower and each Ancillary Lender agrees with and for the benefit of each
Lender that:

(a) the Ancillary Outstandings under any Ancillary Facility provided by that
Ancillary Lender shall not at any time exceed the Ancillary Commitment
applicable to that Ancillary Facility and where the Ancillary Facility is an
overdraft facility comprising more than one account, Ancillary Outstandings
under that Ancillary Facility shall not exceed the Designated Net Amount in
respect of that Ancillary Facility; and


-----

(b) where all or part of the Ancillary Facility is an overdraft facility comprising
more than one account, the Ancillary Outstandings (calculated on the basis that
the words “net of any credit balances on any account of any Borrower of an
Ancillary Facility with the Ancillary Lender making available that Ancillary
Facility to the extent that the credit balances are freely available to be set off by
that Ancillary Lender against liabilities owed to it by that Borrower under that
Ancillary Facility” in brackets in paragraph (a) of the definition of that term
were deleted) shall not exceed the Designated Gross Amount applicable to that
Ancillary Facility.

7.6 **Voluntary cancellation of Ancillary Facilities**

The Obligors’ Agent may, if it gives the Agent and the relevant Ancillary Lender not
less than five Business Days’ prior notice, cancel the whole or any part of the Ancillary
Commitment under an Ancillary Facility.

7.7 **Information**

Each Borrower (or the Obligors’ Agent on behalf of each Borrower) and each Ancillary
Lender shall, promptly upon request by the Agent, supply the Agent with any
information relating to the operation of an Ancillary Facility (including the Ancillary
Outstandings) as the Agent may reasonably request from time to time. Each Borrower
consents to all such information being released to the Agent and the other Finance
Parties.

7.8 **Affiliates of Lenders as Ancillary Lenders**

(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, an Affiliate of a Revolving Facility
Lender may become an Ancillary Lender. In such case, the Revolving Facility
Lender and its Affiliate shall be treated as a single Revolving Facility Lender
whose Revolving Facility Commitment is the amount of such Lender’s
Revolving Facility Commitment under the relevant Revolving Facility. For the
purposes of calculating the Lender’s Available Commitment with respect to the
relevant Revolving Facility, the Lender’s Commitment under the relevant
Revolving Facility shall be reduced to the extent of the aggregate of the
Ancillary Commitments of its Affiliates.

(b) The Obligors’ Agent shall specify any relevant Affiliate of a Revolving Facility
Lender in any notice delivered by the Company to the Agent pursuant to
paragraph (b) of Clause 7.2 (Availability).

(c) An Affiliate of a Revolving Facility Lender which becomes an Ancillary Lender
shall accede to the Intercreditor Agreement and any person who so accedes to
the Intercreditor Agreement shall, at the same time, become a party to this
Agreement as an Ancillary Lender in accordance with clause 20.9 (Creditor
_Accession Undertaking) of the Intercreditor Agreement._

(d) If a Lender assigns all of its rights and benefits or transfers all of its rights and
obligations to a New Lender (as defined in Clause 27 (Changes to the Lenders)),
its Affiliate shall cease to have any obligations under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Document.


-----

(e) Where this Agreement or any other Finance Document imposes an obligation
on an Ancillary Lender and the relevant Ancillary Lender is an Affiliate of a
Lender which is not a party to that document, the relevant Lender shall ensure
that the obligation is performed by its Affiliate.

7.9 **Affiliates of Borrowers**

(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, any Affiliate of a Revolving Facility
Borrower may with the approval of the relevant Ancillary Lender become a
borrower with respect to an Ancillary Facility.

(b) The Obligors’ Agent shall specify any relevant Affiliate of a Revolving Facility
Borrower in any notice delivered by the Company to the Agent pursuant to
paragraph (b) of Clause 7.2 (Availability).

(c) If a Borrower ceases to be a Revolving Facility Borrower under this Agreement
in accordance with Clause 29.4 (Resignation of an Obligor), its Affiliate shall
cease to have any rights under this Agreement or any Ancillary Document,
unless they are an Affiliate of another Borrower.

(d) Where this Agreement or any other Finance Document imposes an obligation
on a Borrower under an Ancillary Facility and the relevant Borrower is an
Affiliate of a Borrower which is not a party to that document, the relevant
Borrower shall ensure that the obligation is performed by its Affiliate.

(e) Any reference in this Agreement or any other Finance Document to a Borrower
being under no obligations (whether actual or contingent) as a Borrower under
such Finance Document shall be construed to include a reference to any
Affiliate of a Borrower being under no obligations under any Finance Document
or Ancillary Document.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, an Affiliate of a Borrower with respect to an
Ancillary Facility shall not constitute a Borrower for the purposes of Clause 39
(Amendments and Waivers) and the terms of Clause 29.2 (Additional Borrowers)
shall not apply to that Affiliate.

7.10 **Revolving Facility Commitment amounts**

Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement, each Lender shall ensure that at all
times its Revolving Facility Commitment is not less than:

(a) its Ancillary Commitment; and

(b) the Ancillary Commitment of its Affiliate.

7.11 **Adjustment for Ancillary Facilities upon acceleration**

(a) In this Clause 7.11:

“Revolving Outstandings” means, in relation to a Lender, the aggregate of the
equivalent in the Base Currency of (i) its participation in each Revolving


-----

Facility Utilisation then outstanding under a particular Revolving Facility
(together with the aggregate amount of all accrued interest, fees and commission
owed to it as a Lender under such Revolving Facility) and (ii) if the Lender is
also an Ancillary Lender, the Ancillary Outstandings in respect of Ancillary
Facilities provided by that Ancillary Lender (or by its Affiliates) (together with
the aggregate amount of all accrued interest, fees and commission owed to it (or
to its Affiliate) as an Ancillary Lender in respect of the Ancillary Facility).

“Total Revolving **Outstandings” means the aggregate of all Revolving**
Outstandings.

(b) If a Declared Default occurs, each Lender and each Ancillary Lender shall
promptly adjust by corresponding transfers (to the extent necessary) their claims
in respect of amounts outstanding to them under the relevant Revolving Facility
and each Ancillary Facility to ensure that after such transfers the Revolving
Outstandings of each Lender bear the same proportion to the relevant Total
Revolving Outstandings as such Lender’s relevant Revolving Facility
Commitment bears to the relevant Total Revolving Facility Commitments, each
as at the date the notice of such Declared Default is served under Clause 26.17
(Acceleration).

(c) If an amount outstanding under an Ancillary Facility is a contingent liability
and that contingent liability becomes an actual liability or is reduced to zero
after the original adjustment is made under paragraph (b) above, then each
Lender and Ancillary Lender will make a further adjustment by corresponding
transfers (to the extent necessary) to put themselves in the position they would
have been in had the original adjustment been determined by reference to the
actual liability or, as the case may be, zero liability and not the contingent
liability.

(d) Prior to the application of the provisions of paragraph (b) above, an Ancillary
Lender that has provided an overdraft comprising more than one account under
an Ancillary Facility shall set off any liabilities owing to it under such overdraft
facility against credit balances on any account comprised in such overdraft
facility.

(e) All calculations to be made pursuant to this Clause 7.11 shall be made by the
Agent based upon information provided to it by the Lenders and Ancillary
Lenders.

7.12 **Continuation of Ancillary Facilities**

(a) A Borrower and an Ancillary Lender may, as between themselves only, agree
that any Ancillary Facilities will continue to remain available on a bilateral basis
following the Termination Date applicable to the relevant Revolving Facility or,
as the case may be, the date the relevant Revolving Facility Commitments are
otherwise cancelled under this Agreement.

(b) If any arrangement contemplated in paragraph (a) above is to occur, each
relevant Borrower and the Ancillary Lender shall each confirm that to be the
case in writing to the Agent. Upon such Termination Date or, as the case may


-----

be, date of cancellation, any such facility shall continue as between the said
entities on a bilateral basis and not as part of, or under, the Finance Documents.
Save for any rights and obligations against any Finance Party under the Finance
Documents arising prior to such Termination Date or, as the case may be, date
of cancellation, no such rights or obligations in respect of such Ancillary
Facility shall, as between the Finance Parties, continue and the Transaction
Security shall not support any such facility in respect of any matters that arise
after such Termination Date or, as the case may be, date of cancellation.

7.13 **Operation of accounts**

Notwithstanding any Security on debts and bank accounts contained in the Transaction
Security Documents and any other provision of any Finance Document, each Ancillary
Lender may subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement:

(a) continue to collect instruments/credits payable to or endorsed in favour of the
Obligors to its accounts with such Ancillary Lender;

(b) permit the Obligors to draw against any existing credit balance and the proceeds
of instruments/credits collected from time to time to its accounts; and

(c) continue to exercise its rights of set-off or combination of accounts.

8. **REPAYMENT**

8.1 **Repayment of Term Loans**

(a) The Facility B Borrower shall repay the Facility B Loans made to it in full on
the Termination Date in respect of Facility B.

(b) [Reserved]

(c) The Acquisition / Capex Facility Borrower shall repay the Acquisition / Capex
Facility Loans made to it in full on the Termination Date in respect of the
Acquisition / Capex Facility.

(d) No Borrower may reborrow any part of a Term Loan which is repaid.

8.2 **Repayment of Additional Facility Loans**

(a) Each Borrower of an Additional Facility Loan shall repay that Additional
Facility Loan borrowed by it:

(i) in relation to an Additional Facility which is repayable in instalments,
in the instalments by repaying on each applicable Amortising Facility
Repayment Date the amount as set out in the table in the relevant
Additional Facility Notice; and

(ii) in relation to an Additional Facility which is not repayable in instalments,
in full on the Termination Date applicable to that Additional Facility
Loan and as set out in the Additional Facility Notice.


-----

(b) The Borrowers may not reborrow any part of an Additional Facility Loan which
is repaid other than Additional Facility Loans relating to an Additional Facility
that is made available by way of a revolving facility, which shall revolve in
accordance with the terms agreed with the relevant Additional Facility Lender.

8.3 **Repayment of Revolving Facility Loans**

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, each Borrower which has drawn a Revolving
Facility Loan shall repay that Revolving Facility Loan on the last day of its
Interest Period.

(b) Without prejudice to each Borrower’s obligation under paragraph (a) above, if:

(i) one or more Revolving Facility Loans are to be made available to a
Revolving Facility Borrower:

(A) on the same day that a maturing Revolving Facility Loan is due
to be repaid by that Revolving Facility Borrower;

(B) in the same currency as the maturing Revolving Facility Loan
(unless it arose as a result of the operation of Clause 6.2
(Unavailability of a currency)); and

(C) in whole or in part for the purpose of refinancing the maturing
Revolving Facility Loan; and

(ii) the proportion borne by each Lender’s participation in the maturing
Revolving Facility Loan to the amount of that maturing Revolving
Facility Loan is the same as the proportion borne by that Lender’s
participation in the new Revolving Facility Loans to the aggregate
amount of those new Revolving Facility Loans,

the aggregate amount of the new Revolving Facility Loans shall be treated as if
applied in or towards repayment of the maturing Revolving Facility Loan so
that:

(A) if the amount of the maturing Revolving Facility Loan exceeds
the aggregate amount of the new Revolving Facility Loans:

(1) the relevant Revolving Facility Borrower will only be
required to pay an amount in cash in the relevant
currency equal to that excess; and

(2) each Revolving Facility Lender’s participation (if any) in
the new Revolving Facility Loans shall be treated as
having been made available and applied by the
Revolving Facility Borrower in or towards repayment of
that Revolving Facility Lender’s participation (if any) in
the maturing Revolving Facility Loan and that Revolving
Facility Lender will not be required to make its


-----

participation in the new Revolving Facility Loans
available in cash; and

(B) if the amount of the maturing Revolving Facility Loan is equal
to or less than the aggregate amount of the new Revolving
Facility Loans:

(1) the relevant Revolving Facility Borrower will not be
required to make any payment in cash; and

(2) each Revolving Facility Lender will be required to make
its participation in the new Revolving Facility Loans
available in cash only to the extent that its participation
(if any) in the new Revolving Facility Loans exceeds that
Revolving Facility Lender’s participation (if any) in the
maturing Revolving Facility Loan and the remainder of
that Revolving Facility Lender’s participation in the new
Revolving Facility Loans shall be treated as having been
made available and applied by the Revolving Facility
Borrower in or towards repayment of that Revolving
Facility Lender’s participation in the maturing Revolving
Facility Loan.

(c) At any time when a Revolving Facility Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender,
the maturity date of each of the participations of that Lender in the Revolving
Facility Loans then outstanding will be automatically extended to the
Termination Date in relation to the Revolving Facility and will be treated as
separate Revolving Facility Loans or as (the case may be) revolving Additional
Facility Loans (the “Separate Loans”) denominated in the currency in which
the relevant participations are outstanding.

(d) A Borrower to whom a Separate Loan is outstanding may prepay that Loan by
giving not less than three Business Days’ prior notice to the Agent. The Agent
will forward a copy of a prepayment notice received in accordance with this
paragraph (d) to the Defaulting Lender concerned as soon as practicable on
receipt.

(e) Interest in respect of a Separate Loan will accrue for successive Interest Periods
selected by the Borrower (or the Company on its behalf) by the time and date
specified by the Agent (acting reasonably) and will be payable by that Borrower
to the Agent (for the account of the Defaulting Lender) on the last day of each
Interest Period of that Loan.

(f) The terms of this Agreement relating to Revolving Facility Loans generally
shall continue to apply to Separate Loans other than to the extent inconsistent
with paragraphs (c) to (e) above, in which case those paragraphs shall prevail in
respect of any Separate Loan.


-----

8.4 **Effect of cancellation and prepayment on scheduled repayments**

(a) To the extent that any Amortising Facility Repayment Instalment is determined:

(i) prior to the utilisation of that Amortising Facility, by reference to a fixed
number; or

(ii) in full or in part by reference to any Available Commitment in respect
of that Amortising Facility,

if the whole or any part of an Available Commitment in respect of that
Amortising Facility is cancelled (other than to the extent that the Available
Commitment under that Amortising Facility is subsequently increased pursuant
to Clause 2.3 (Increase) but only to the extent of that increase), such
cancellation shall reduce each Amortising Facility Repayment Instalment in
respect of that Amortising Facility on a pro rata basis.

(b) If the whole or any part of an Amortising Facility Loan is prepaid, such
prepayment shall reduce each Amortising Facility Repayment Instalment in
respect of that Amortising Facility as elected by the Obligors’ Agent or the
applicable Borrower (in each case, in its sole discretion).

8.5 **Allocation of Amortising Facility repayment instalments**

If more than one Loan is outstanding under any Amortising Facility, the Obligors’
Agent may (in its sole discretion) reallocate all or part of Amortising Facility
Repayment Instalment due in respect of a Loan under such Amortising Facility (the
“First Loan”) to any other Loan under such Amortising Facility (the “Second Loan”),
such that:

(a) the Amortising Facility Repayment Instalment due in respect of the First Loan
shall be reduced by the amount elected by the Obligors’ Agent; and

(b) the Amortising Facility Repayment Instalment due in respect of the Second
Loan shall be increased by the amount by which the Amortising Facility
Repayment Instalment in respect of the First Loan is reduced pursuant to
paragraph (a) above.

9. **ILLEGALITY, VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENT AND CANCELLATION**

9.1 **Illegality**

If after the date of this Agreement (or, if later, the date the relevant Lender became a
Party) it becomes unlawful in any applicable jurisdiction for a Lender (or an Affiliate
of a Lender) to perform any of its obligations as contemplated by this Agreement or to
fund, issue or maintain its participation in any Utilisation or participation in a Loan:

(a) that Lender shall promptly notify the Agent upon becoming aware of that event,
setting out details thereof, and the Agent shall notify the Obligors’ Agent as
soon as reasonably practicable after receiving such notice (such notice, an
“Illegality Notice”);


-----

(b) upon the Agent notifying the Obligors’ Agent, the Available Commitment of
that Lender will be immediately cancelled; and

(c) to the extent that Lender’s participation has not been transferred pursuant to
Clause 39.4 (Replacement of Finance Party), each Borrower shall repay that
Lender’s participation in the Utilisations made to that Borrower on the last day
of the Interest Period for each Utilisation occurring after the Agent has notified
the Obligors’ Agent or, if earlier, the date specified by the Lender in the
Illegality Notice (being no earlier than the last day of any applicable grace
period permitted by law) and that Lender’s corresponding Commitment(s) shall
be cancelled in the amount of the participations repaid.

9.2 **Voluntary cancellation**

(a) The Company may, if it gives the Agent not less than three Business Days’ (or
such shorter period as the Majority Lenders under the relevant Facility may
agree) prior notice, cancel the whole or any part (being a minimum amount of
£1,000,000 or its equivalent in any other currency and multiples thereof) of an
Available Facility. Any cancellation under this Clause 9.2 shall reduce the
Commitments of the Lenders rateably under that Facility.

(b) This Clause 9.2 is subject to Clause 9.7 (Revolving Facility Commitment Cap).

9.3 **Voluntary prepayment of Term Loans**

(a) A Borrower to which a Term Loan has been made may, if it or the Obligors’

(i) in the case of a Term Rate Loan, three Business Days’ (or such shorter
period as the Majority Lenders under the relevant Facility may agree)
prior notice; or

(ii) in the case of a Compounded Rate Loan, three RFR Banking Days’ (or
such shorter period as the Majority Lenders under the relevant Facility
may agree) prior notice,

prepay the whole or any part of that Term Loan (but, if in part, being an amount
that reduces the amount of that Term Loan by a minimum amount of £1,000,000
or its equivalent in any other currency and multiples thereof).

(b) Any voluntary prepayment proceeds shall be applied in prepayment of the Term
Loans and by the relevant Borrowers (as applicable), in each case as selected by
the Obligors’ Agent.

(c) This Clause 9.3 is subject to Clause 9.7 (Revolving Facility Commitment Cap).

9.4 **Voluntary prepayment of Revolving Facility Utilisations**

(a) A Revolving Facility Borrower may, if it or the Obligors’ Agent gives the Agent
not less than:


-----

(i) in the case of a Term Rate Loan, three Business Days’ (or such shorter
period as the Majority Lenders under the relevant Facility may agree)
prior notice; or

(ii) in the case of a Compounded Rate Loan, three RFR Banking Days’ (or
such shorter period as the Majority Lenders under the relevant Facility
may agree) prior notice,

prepay the whole or any part of a Revolving Facility Utilisation (but if in part,
being an amount that reduces the amount of the Revolving Facility Utilisation
by a minimum amount of £1,000,000 or its equivalent in any other currency and
multiples thereof).

(b) Any voluntary prepayment proceeds shall be applied in prepayment of
Revolving Facility Loans as selected by the Company.

9.5 **Right of cancellation and repayment in relation to a single Lender**

(a) If:

(i) any sum payable to any Lender by the Company or an Obligor is
required to be increased under Clause 16.2 (Tax gross-up) or under the
equivalent provision of any Finance Document;

(ii) any Lender claims indemnification from the Company or an Obligor
under Clause 16.3 (Tax indemnity) or Clause 17.1 (Increased costs);

(iii) any Lender becomes or is a Non-Consenting Lender; or

(iv) any Lender requests payment from the Company or any Obligor based
on the occurrence of a Market Disruption Event,

the Obligors’ Agent may, whilst the circumstance giving rise to the requirement
for that increase, indemnification, consent process or Market Disruption Event
continues, give the Agent notice (if such circumstances relate to a Lender) of
cancellation of the Commitment(s) of that Lender and its intention to procure
the repayment of that Lender’s participation in the Utilisations.

(b) On receipt of a notice referred to in paragraph (a) above in relation to a Lender,
the Commitment(s) of that Lender shall immediately be reduced to zero.

(c) On the last day of each Interest Period which ends after the Company has given
notice under paragraph (a) above in relation to a Lender (or, if earlier, the date
specified by the Company in that notice), each Borrower to which a Utilisation
is outstanding shall repay that Lender’s participation in that Utilisation together
with all interest and other amounts accrued under the Finance Documents.

9.6 **Right of cancellation in relation to a Defaulting Lender**

(a) If any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, the Company may, at any time
whilst the Lender continues to be a Defaulting Lender, give the Agent three


-----

Business Days’ notice of cancellation of each Available Commitment of that
Lender.

(b) On the notice referred to in paragraph (a) above becoming effective, each
Available Commitment of the Defaulting Lender shall immediately be reduced
to zero.

(c) The Agent shall as soon as practicable after receipt of a notice referred to in
paragraph (a) above, notify all the Lenders.

9.7 **Revolving Facility Commitment Cap**

To the extent that any voluntary cancellation or voluntary prepayment, in each case,
with regards to any Term Facility made pursuant to Clauses 9.2 (Voluntary cancellation)
or 9.3 (Voluntary prepayment of Term Loans), respectively (each a “Voluntary Term
**Facility Reduction”), would result in the Total Revolving Facility Commitments**
exceeding 30 per cent. of the Total Commitments at any time, such Voluntary Term
Facility Reduction shall be accompanied by a voluntary cancellation and/or voluntary
prepayment, in each case, with regards to the Revolving Facilities (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, provided that any such voluntary prepayment is accompanied with
a corresponding cancellation of Revolving Facility Commitments) such that in no event
shall the Total Revolving Facility Commitments exceed 30 per cent. of the Total
Commitments.

in a Change of Control (each an “Exit Event”):

(i) the Obligors’ Agent will promptly notify the Agent upon becoming
aware of that event; and

(ii) each Lender shall be entitled to cancel its Commitments and require
repayment of all of its share of the Utilisations and payment of all
amounts owing to it under the Finance Documents, by written notice to
the Agent within 30 days of the Obligors’ Agent notifying the Agent of
the Exit Event, whereupon:

(A) the undrawn Commitments of such Lender shall, by notice to the
Obligors’ Agent, be cancelled and such Lender shall have no
obligation to fund or participate in any new Utilisation or
utilisation of an Ancillary Facility (other than (1) a Rollover
Loan or (2) a Utilisation of an Ancillary Facility to refinance any
amount falling due under an Ancillary Facility); and

(B) on the date falling 30 days after such Lender provides written
notice to the Agent, all outstanding Utilisations provided by such
Lender and Ancillary Outstandings of such Lender, together
with accrued interest, and all other amounts accrued or owing to


-----

such Lender under the Finance Documents shall become
immediately due and payable (or in the case of a Change of
Control which results from a Listing, on the settlement date in
respect of that Listing), and the relevant Borrower will
immediately prepay all Utilisations and amounts provided by or
owing to that Lender and procure that any cash collateral
provided by that Lender is released and (unless otherwise agreed
between the Obligors’ Agent and that Lender) any Ancillary
Facility provided by that Lender is prepaid and cancelled.

If a Lender has not notified the Agent in accordance with the provisions of this
paragraph (a) within 30 days of being notified of such Exit Event by the Agent
in accordance with this paragraph (a), in respect of that Exit Event (only), that
Lender shall not be able to cancel its Commitments or require repayment of all
or any part of its share of the Utilisations and the prepayment of any other
amount owing to it under the Finance Document pursuant to this paragraph (a).

(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) above, prior to the occurrence of an Exit Event,
the Company may (in its sole discretion) notify the Agent that, upon the
occurrence of an Exit Event as and when it occurs, the Facilities will be
cancelled and all outstanding Utilisations, together with accrued interest and all
other amounts accrued under the Finance Documents, shall become
immediately due and payable.

(c) Unless otherwise agreed by the Majority Lenders, upon the occurrence of a
Listing (not resulting in a Change of Control), the Obligors’ Agent will:

(i) promptly notify the Agent upon becoming aware of that event; and

(ii) ensure that:

(A) if the Leverage Ratio (calculated on a pro forma basis) on the
Applicable Test Date prior to the Listing (calculated in
accordance with Clause 24 (Financial Covenants)) is greater
than Opening Leverage, 50 per cent. of the IPO Proceeds shall
be applied in prepayment of the Facilities in accordance with
Clause 10.3 (Application of prepayments) to the extent required
to reduce the Leverage Ratio (calculated on a pro forma basis)
to 4.00:1;

(B) if the Leverage Ratio (calculated on a pro forma basis) on the
Applicable Test Date prior to the Listing (calculated in
accordance with Clause 24 (Financial Covenants)) is (or
becomes, taking into account the application of any prepayment
required under paragraph (A) above) equal to or less than 4.00:1
but greater than 3.50:1, 25 per cent. of the remaining IPO
Proceeds shall be applied in prepayment of the Facilities in
accordance with Clause 10.3 (Application of prepayments) to the
extent required to reduce the Leverage Ratio (calculated on a pro
_forma basis) to 3.50:1; and_


-----

(C) if the Leverage Ratio (calculated on a pro forma basis) on the
Applicable Test Date prior to the Listing for which Financial
Statements are available (calculated in accordance with Clause
24 (Financial Covenants)) is (or becomes, taking into account
the application of any prepayment required under paragraphs (A)
and (B) above) less than or equal to 3.50:1, no prepayment of the
remaining IPO Proceeds shall be required to be made,

**provided that, if, on applying IPO Proceeds in prepayment of the**
Facilities in accordance with this paragraph, such prepayment results in
the Leverage Ratio (calculated on a _pro forma basis) falling into any_
lower threshold, the relevant percentage shall be reduced accordingly
for any further payments to be made on that date and at any time
thereafter and, for the avoidance of doubt, any remaining IPO Proceeds
following prepayment in accordance with this paragraph may be
retained by the Group for any purpose not prohibited by the Finance
Documents.

(d) The Obligors’ Agent may elect that any prepayment under paragraphs (a), (b)
or (c) above shall be applied in prepayment of a Loan on the last day of the
Interest Period relating to that Loan.

(e) If the Obligors’ Agent has made an election under paragraph (d) above but a
Declared Default has occurred and is continuing, that election shall no longer
apply and any prepayment required to be made pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b)
or (c) above shall be immediately due and payable (unless the Agent (acting on
the instructions of all Lenders) has agreed otherwise in writing).

Proceeds, Third Party IDP Net Cash Disposal Proceeds and to the extent relating
to any Significant Disposal (but subject to paragraph (c) below) shall be applied

any Facility in the form of a term facility (and the Available
Commitment of the respective Lenders under each Facility will be
cancelled rateably);

(iii) _thirdly, in pro rata cancellation of the Available Commitments under_
each Revolving Facility (and the Available Commitment of the
respective Lenders under the relevant Revolving Facility will be

(iv) _fourthly, in permanent prepayment and cancellation of Revolving_
Facility Utilisations and cancellation of Revolving Facility
Commitments on a pro rata basis; and


-----

(v) _fifthly, in prepayment and cancellation of the Ancillary Outstandings and_
Ancillary Commitments on a pro rata basis.

(c) The proceeds of prepayments made pursuant to Clause 10.2 (Disposal,
_Insurance and Recovery Proceeds) to the extent relating to any Significant_
Disposal, shall be applied in the following order:

(i) _first, in pro rata prepayment of the Senior Facility and each Additional_

paragraph (e) below.

(e) The Obligors’ Agent and each other Obligor shall use all reasonable endeavours
to ensure that any transaction giving rise to a prepayment obligation is
structured in such a way that it will not be unlawful for the members of the
Group to move the relevant proceeds received between members of the Group
to enable a mandatory prepayment to be lawfully made and the proceeds
lawfully applied as prescribed above and/or to minimise the costs of making
such mandatory prepayment (including using all reasonable endeavours to fund
such payment from surplus cash in the Group). If, however:

(i) the cost of making (or moving the funds to make) such mandatory
prepayment (other than for a Sale) would exceed 3 per cent. of the
amount of such prepayment at that time or it gives rise to a risk of
liability for the entity concerned or its directors or officers; or


-----

(ii) after the Obligors’ Agent and each such member of the Group has used
all such reasonable endeavours and taken such reasonable steps, it is still:

(A) unlawful (including, without limitation, by reason of financial
assistance, corporate benefit restrictions on upstreaming cash
intra-Group and the fiduciary and statutory duties of the directors
of any member of the Group) for such a prepayment to be made
and/or cash cover to be provided and the proceeds so applied;

(B) unlawful (including, without limitation, by reason of financial
assistance, corporate benefit restrictions on upstreaming cash
intra-Group and the fiduciary and statutory duties of the directors
of any member of the Group) to make funds available to a
member of the Group that could make such a prepayment and/or
provide such cash cover,

then, such prepayment shall not be required to be made (and the relevant amount
shall be available for the Group and shall not be required to be paid to a blocked
account **provided always that if the restriction preventing such**
payment/provision of cash cover or giving rise to such liability is subsequently
removed, any relevant proceeds will immediately be applied in prepayment as
prescribed above at the end of the relevant Interest Period(s) to the extent that
such payment has not otherwise been made).

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event any
Disposal Proceeds, Specified Asset Disposal Proceeds, Third Party IDP Net
Cash Disposal Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds, IPO Proceeds and/or Recovery
Proceeds are received by any member of the Group the entire issued share
capital of which (or any other ownership interest in which) is not directly or
indirectly owned by the Company, the amount required to be applied in
prepayment pursuant to this Agreement in respect of such proceeds (after taking
into account of all applicable exceptions and exclusions but without double
counting any such deduction) shall be reduced by a percentage equal to the
percentage of the share capital of (or other ownership interests in) that member
of the Group which is not directly or indirectly held by the Company.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Finance Document (including
this Clause 10):

(i) subject to paragraph (ii) below, any amount required to be applied in
prepayment of the Facilities pursuant to paragraph (c) of Clause 10.1
(Exit and Listing) and Clause 10.2 (Disposal, Insurance and Recovery
_Proceeds) may, at the option of the Obligors’ Agent, be applied between_
a Senior Facility (and/or a Super Senior Facility, if required) and all or
any part of any other Financial Indebtedness permitted under this
Agreement which ranks _pari passu_ with the applicable Facilities
**provided that unless paragraph (ii) below applies:**

(A) the amount applied against a Senior Facility (and/or a Super
Senior Facility, if required) may not be less than a pro rata share
of the relevant prepayment amount (with such _pro rata_


-----

entitlement to be calculated on the basis of the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the Loans under the relevant
Senior Facility (and/or Super Senior Facility, as applicable)
compared to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all
other Financial Indebtedness permitted under this Agreement
which ranks _pari passu with the applicable Facilities at the_
relevant time); and

(B) for this purpose only, any prepayment amount waived by a
Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been applied against the applicable Facility; and

(ii) if the Leverage Ratio is equal to or less than Opening Leverage (adjusted
as if (i) any relevant prepayment and/or other application had taken place
on the last day of the applicable Relevant Period and assuming that all
relevant holders of Financial Indebtedness accept that prepayment
and/or other application and (ii) the event from which the relevant
proceeds originated had taken place on the first day of the applicable
Relevant Period), the amount required to be applied in prepayment
pursuant to paragraph (c) of Clause 10.1 (Exit and Listing) and Clause
10.2 (Disposal, Insurance and Recovery Proceeds) shall be reduced by
any amount instead applied in directly or indirectly reducing the amount
of any other Financial Indebtedness of any member of the Group which
ranks pari passu with the applicable Facilities (in each case to the extent
that such application is not prohibited by the terms of this Agreement or
the Intercreditor Agreement (as the case may be)),

**provided that any prepayment of Revolving Facility Utilisations in accordance**
with this paragraph (g) shall be accompanied with a corresponding cancellation
of Revolving Facility Commitments.

(h) If any Term Loans are prepaid in accordance with Clause 9.3 (Voluntary
_prepayment of Term Loans) then:_

(i) the Company may, by giving not less than three Business Days’ notice
to the Agent, select in the case of a Term Facility, which Borrower or
Borrowers (if more than one) under that Term Facility shall effect
repayment of each Loan; or

(ii) if the Company does not make an election under this paragraph, each
Borrower shall effect such repayment on a pro rata basis.

10.4 **Excluded proceeds**

Any proceeds of a Listing, Disposal, Specified Asset Disposal, Third Party IDP
Disposal, insurance claim or Recovery Claim (as the case may be) shall, pending
potential application for a specific purpose within a specified period (as permitted or
required in the applicable definition of Excluded IPO Proceeds, Excluded Recovery
Proceeds, Excluded Disposal Proceeds or Excluded Insurance Proceeds) or prepayment
under the provisions of this Agreement (and without prejudice to any potential future


-----

prepayment obligation) be available for use by the Group for any purposes permitted
under or not prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

(b) A Borrower or the Obligors’ Agent may deliver a conditional or revocable

affected Lender, as appropriate.

11.9 **Effect of repayment and prepayment on Commitments**

Any prepayment of a Utilisation (other than a prepayment pursuant to Clause 9.1
(Illegality) or Clause 9.5 (Right of cancellation and repayment in relation to a single

The Borrower to which a Loan has been made shall, subject to Clause 12.6 (PIK
_Toggle), pay accrued interest on that Loan on the last day of each Interest Period (and,_

intervals after the first day of the Interest Period) and shall pay any additional amounts
payable pursuant to the definition of Margin promptly following any such
determination.

12.4 **Default interest**

(a) If an Obligor or the Parent fails to pay any amount payable by it under a Finance

on the overdue amount from the due date up to the date of actual payment (both
before and after judgment) at a rate which, subject to paragraph (b) below, is
2.00 per cent. per annum higher than the rate which would have been payable if
the overdue amount had, during the period of non-payment, constituted a Loan
in the currency of the overdue amount for successive Interest Periods, each of a
duration selected by the Agent (acting reasonably). Any interest accruing under
this Clause 12.4 shall be immediately payable by the Obligor or the Parent on
demand by the Agent.


-----

(b) If any overdue amount consists of all or part of a Term Rate Loan which became
due on a day which was not the last day of an Interest Period relating to that
Loan:

(i) the first Interest Period for that overdue amount shall have a duration
equal to the unexpired portion of the current Interest Period relating to
that Loan; and

Interest Period shall be 2.00 per cent. per annum higher than the rate
which would have applied if the overdue amount had not become due.

Rate Interest Payment;

(ii) each relevant Lender of the proportion of that Compounded Rate Interest
Payment which relates to that Lender’s participation in the relevant
Compounded Rate Loan; and

(iii) the relevant Lenders and the relevant Borrower (or the Obligors’ Agent)
of:

(A) each applicable rate of interest relating to the determination of

12.6 **PIK Toggle**

(a) A Borrower (or the Company on behalf of a Borrower) may, at least five
Business Days before the proposed Toggle Date (as defined below) elect by
providing notice to the Agent (a “Toggle Election”) to convert up to 2.00 per


-----

cent. per annum in respect of Facility B and/or the Acquisition / Capex Facility
(a “Toggled Facility”) into interest which capitalises and accrues at the end of
that Interest Period (“PIK Interest”) payable in accordance with this Clause
12.6, provided that no Event of Default is continuing on the date of the Toggle
Election.

(b) A Toggle Election shall specify:

(i) the number of Interest Periods for which a Toggle Election will apply,
or otherwise that such Toggle Election will apply until the date specified
by the relevant Borrower (or the Company on behalf of that Borrower)
in a Toggle Revocation (as defined below);

(ii) the date from which the Toggle Election shall apply (the “Toggle Date”),
which shall be:

(A) the first day of the next commencing Interest Period so that the

Election applies in respect of all interest already accrued (but not
yet been paid) and accruing during the current Interest Period;
and

(iii) the relevant part of the Margin which is to be converted into PIK Interest
(the “PIK Margin”).

(c) During the PIK Period and if a Toggle Election is in effect in accordance with
this Clause 12.6, from the Toggle Date:

(i) subject to paragraph (ii) below, the Margin element of the rate of interest
referred to in Clause 12.1 (Calculation of interest – Term Rate Loans)
and Clause 12.2 (Calculation of interest – Compounded Rate Loans) in
respect of the relevant Toggled Facility shall be reduced by the PIK
Margin (the remaining element of the Margin following that reduction
being the “Remaining Cash Margin”);

(ii) for up to the first 1.00 per cent. of the Margin that is converted into PIK
Interest, the PIK Margin shall be increased by 0.50 per cent. per annum
and for up to the next 1.00 per cent. of the Margin that is converted into
PIK Interest thereafter, the PIK Margin shall be increased by 0.75 per
cent. per annum (so that, for the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate of the
PIK Margin and the Remaining Cash Margin shall be 0.50 per cent. per
annum or 1.25 per cent. per annum (as applicable) higher than the
relevant percentage specified in the definition of Margin); and

(iii) PIK Interest shall be capitalised on the last day of each Interest Period
and, once capitalised, shall be treated as part of the principal amount of
each applicable Loan.


-----

(d) If an amount of PIK Interest is capitalised as set out in paragraph (c)(iii) above
(“Capitalised PIK”) the Commitments of each Lender under the relevant
Toggled Facility shall be increased with an amount that bears the same
proportion to that Capitalised PIK as that Lender’s Commitments under the
relevant Toggled Facility bears to the Total Commitments under that Facility.

(e) Any PIK Interest accruing but not capitalised in accordance with paragraph (c)
above shall become immediately payable if, during the relevant Interest Period,
all amounts due in respect of the Loan become immediately due and payable
under Clause 26.17 (Acceleration), or the applicable Loan is repaid or prepaid
in full in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(f) The Company may, at any time, by providing notice to the Agent (a “Toggle
**Revocation”) revoke a Toggle Election such that any PIK Interest accruing**
and/or capitalised as of the date specified by the Company in that notice to the
Agent may be payable in cash as if such Toggle Election had not been in effect
**provided that such date is:**

(i) the first day of the then current Interest Period; or

(ii) the last day of the then current or any future Interest Period.

(g) For the purpose of paragraph (f) above, any Toggle Revocation shall be
delivered at least five Business Days prior to the last day of the applicable
Interest Period in respect of which the Toggle Revocation shall apply.

shall not include a Toggle Election in respect of which a Toggle Revocation has
been delivered.

than pursuant to paragraph (i) of the definition of “Permitted Payment”) shall
be made unless and until all amounts of PIK Interest outstanding at that time are
discharged in full.

notification by the Company under this Clause 12.6.

-----

14.2 **Market disruption**

(a) If a Market Disruption Event occurs in relation to a Term Rate Loan
denominated in Euro, for any Interest Period, then the rate of interest on each
Lender’s share of that Loan for the Interest Period shall be the percentage rate

in any event by close of business on the date falling two Business Days
after the Quotation Day (or, if earlier, on the date falling five Business
Days prior to the date on which interest is due to be paid in respect of
that Interest Period), to be that which expresses as a percentage rate per
annum the cost to that Lender of funding its participation in that Loan
from whatever source it may reasonably select **provided that if any**
Lender is a fund (and only to the extent it actually borrows monies which
are subject to EURIBOR to fund its participation in that Loan (in whole
or in part)), the cost of funding its participation in that Loan should be
no more than the cost to such fund of borrowing any amount used to
fund its participation in that Loan (the “Funding Rate”),

than EURIBOR, or a Lender has not notified the Agent of a percentage rate per
annum, the cost of that Lender of funding its participation in that Loan for that

EURIBOR.

(b) In this Agreement:

“Market Disruption Event” means:

(i) at or about noon on the Quotation Day for the relevant Interest Period in

Interest Period in respect of a Term Rate Loan denominated in Euro, the
Agent receives notifications from a Lender or Lenders (whose
participations in a Term Rate Loan exceed 50 per cent. of that Loan) that
the cost to it of funding its participation in that Loan from whatever
source it may reasonably select would be in excess of EURIBOR
**provided that if any Lender is a fund, such rate shall be the Funding**
Rate.

14.3 **Alternative basis of interest or funding**

(a) If a Market Disruption Event occurs and the Agent or the Obligors’ Agent so
requires, the Agent and the Obligors’ Agent shall enter into negotiations (for a

publicly available source of similar market data)) most nearly equal to the
period from that Prepayment Date to (and excluding) the MW End Date;

(a) Each Obligor shall make all payments to be made by it without any Tax
Deduction, unless a Tax Deduction is required by law.

(b) The Company shall promptly upon becoming aware that an Obligor must make
a Tax Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of a Tax
Deduction) notify the Agent accordingly. Similarly, a Lender shall promptly
notify the Agent on becoming so aware in respect of a payment payable to that
Lender. If the Agent receives such notification from a Lender it shall promptly
notify the Company and that Obligor.

(c) If a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by an Obligor, the amount of
the payment due from that Obligor shall be increased to an amount which (after
making any Tax Deduction) leaves an amount equal to the payment which
would have been due if no Tax Deduction had been required.

(d) A payment by an Obligor shall not be increased under paragraph (c) above by
reason of a Tax Deduction on account of Tax imposed by the United Kingdom,
if on the date on which the payment falls due:

(i) the payment could have been made to the relevant Lender without a Tax
Deduction if the Lender had been a Qualifying Lender, but on that date
that Lender is not or has ceased to be a Qualifying Lender other than as
a result of any change after the date it became a Lender under this


-----

Agreement in (or in the interpretation, administration, or application of)
any law or Treaty or any published practice or published concession of
any relevant taxing authority;

(ii) the relevant Lender is a Qualifying Lender solely by virtue of paragraph
(b) of the definition of “Qualifying Lender” and:

revoked) a direction (a “Direction”) under section 931 of the
ITA which relates to the payment and that Lender has received
from the Obligor making the payment or from the Parent a
certified copy of that Direction; and

(B) the payment could have been made to the Lender without any
Tax Deduction if that Direction had not been made; or

(iii) the relevant Lender is a Qualifying Lender solely by virtue of paragraph
(b) of the definition of “Qualifying Lender” and:

Parent; and

(B) the payment could have been made to the Lender without any
Tax Deduction if the Lender had given a Tax Confirmation to
the Parent, on the basis that the Tax Confirmation would have
enabled the Parent to have formed a reasonable belief that the
payment was an "excepted payment" for the purpose of section
930 of the ITA; or

(iv) the relevant Lender is a Treaty Lender and the Obligor making the
payment is able to demonstrate that the payment could have been made
to the Lender without the Tax Deduction had that Lender complied with

in connection with that Tax Deduction, the Obligor making that Tax Deduction
shall deliver to the Agent for the Finance Party entitled to the payment, a
statement under section 975 ITA, confirmation of the Tax Deduction from the
Guernsey Revenue Service, or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to that
Finance Party that the Tax Deduction has been made or (as applicable) any
appropriate payment paid to the relevant taxing authority.

(g) Subject to paragraph (h) below, each Treaty Lender and each Obligor which
makes a payment to which that Treaty Lender is entitled shall co-operate in

authorisation to make that payment without a Tax Deduction (or with a reduced
Tax Deduction where a full Tax Deduction is not available).

(iii) a Treaty Lender which obtains a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty
Passport Scheme after the date of this Agreement (in the case of an

procedural formalities necessary for that Borrower to obtain
authorisation to make that payment without a Tax Deduction.

tax residence in accordance with paragraph (g) above, no Obligor shall make a

Finance Party; or

(A) is compensated for by an increased payment under Clause 16.2
(Tax gross-up);

under Clause 16.2 (Tax gross-up) but was not so compensated
solely because one of the exclusions in paragraph (d) of Clause
16.2 (Tax gross-up) applied;

(C) relates to a FATCA Deduction required to be made by a Party;
or

(D) is compensated for by Clause 16.6 (Stamp taxes) or Clause 16.7

16.5 **Lender confirmations**

(a) Each Lender that becomes a Party to this Agreement after the date of this
Agreement shall indicate, in the Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement,

or

(iii) a Treaty Lender or an Exempt Lender (assuming the completion of any
procedural formalities).

(b) If a New Lender, an Additional Facility Lender or an Increase Lender fails to

shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement (including by each Obligor)
as if it is not a Qualifying Lender until such time as it notifies the Agent which
category applies (and the Agent, upon receipt of such notification, shall inform
the Company). A Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement, Additional
Facility Notice or Increase Confirmation shall not be invalidated by any failure
of a Lender to comply with this Clause 16.5.

(c) Each Lender shall notify the Agent if:

(i) it becomes aware that it is not, or ceases to be, a Qualifying Lender in

respect to each Obligor that was a party to this Agreement at the date

registration or other similar Taxes payable in respect of an assignment or transfer or
sub-participation or sub-contract by a Lender of any of its rights or obligations under a
Finance Document save for any assignment, transfer, sub-participation or sub-contract
made pursuant to Clause 19.1 (Mitigation).

16.7 **VAT**

(a) All amounts expressed to be payable under a Finance Document by any Party
to a Finance Party which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for
any supply for VAT purposes are deemed to be exclusive of any VAT which is
chargeable on that supply, and accordingly, subject to paragraph (b) below, if
VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Finance Party to any
Party under a Finance Document and such Finance Party is required to account
to the relevant tax authority for the VAT, that Party must pay to such Finance
Party (in addition to and at the same time as paying any other consideration for
such supply) an amount equal to the amount of the VAT (and such Finance
Party must promptly provide an appropriate VAT invoice to that Party).

(b) If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Finance Party (the
“Supplier”) to any other Finance Party (the “Recipient”) under a Finance
Document, and any Party other than the Recipient (the “Relevant Party”) is
required by the terms of any Finance Document to pay an amount equal to the
consideration for that supply to the Supplier (rather than being required to
reimburse or indemnify the Recipient in respect of that consideration):

(i) (where the Supplier is the person required to account to the relevant tax
authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must also pay to the Supplier
(at the same time as paying that amount) an additional amount equal to
the amount of the VAT. The Recipient must (where this paragraph (i)
applies) promptly pay to the Relevant Party an amount equal to any
credit or repayment the Recipient receives from the relevant tax
authority which the Recipient reasonably determines relates to the VAT
chargeable on that supply; and


-----

(ii) (where the Recipient is the person required to account to the relevant tax
authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must promptly, following
demand from the Recipient, pay to the Recipient an amount equal to the
VAT chargeable on that supply but only to the extent that the Recipient
reasonably determines that it is not entitled to credit or repayment from
the relevant tax authority in respect of that VAT.

(c) Where a Finance Document requires any Party to reimburse or indemnify a
Finance Party for any cost or expense, that Party shall reimburse or indemnify
(as the case may be) such Finance Party for the full amount of such cost or
expense, including such part thereof as represents VAT, save to the extent that
such Finance Party reasonably determines that it is entitled to credit or
repayment in respect of such VAT from the relevant tax authority.

(d) Any reference in this Clause 16.7 to any Party shall, at any time when such Party
is treated as a member of a group (including but not limited to any fiscal unities)
for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and unless the context otherwise
requires) a reference to the person who is treated as making or receiving the
supply (as the case may be) for the purposes of any relevant VAT grouping rules.

(e) In relation to any supply made by a Finance Party to any Party under a Finance
Document, if reasonably requested by such Finance Party, that Party must
promptly provide such Finance Party with details of that Party’s VAT
registration and such other information as is reasonably requested in connection
with such Finance Party’s VAT reporting requirements in relation to such
supply.

reasonable request by another Party:

(i) confirm to that other Party whether it is:

(A) a FATCA Exempt Party; or

(B) not a FATCA Exempt Party;

(ii) supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other
information relating to its status under FATCA as that other Party
reasonably requests for the purposes of that other Party’s compliance
with FATCA; and

(iii) supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other
information relating to its status as that other Party reasonably requests
for the purposes of that other Party’s compliance with any other law,
regulation, or exchange of information regime.

(b) If a Party confirms to another Party pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) above that it is
a FATCA Exempt Party and it subsequently becomes aware that it is not, or has


-----

ceased to be a FATCA Exempt Party, that Party shall notify that other Party
reasonably promptly.

(c) Paragraph (a) above shall not oblige any Finance Party to do anything, and
paragraph (a)(iii) above shall not oblige any other Party to do anything, which
would or might in its reasonable opinion constitute a breach of:

(i) any law or regulation;

(ii) any fiduciary duty; or

(iii) any duty of confidentiality.

(d) If a Party fails to confirm whether or not it is a FATCA Exempt Party or to
supply forms, documentation or other information requested in accordance with
paragraph (a)(i) or (ii) above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, where
paragraph (c) above applies), then such Party shall be treated for the purposes
of the Finance Documents (and payments under them) as if it is not a FATCA
Exempt Party until such time as the Party in question provides the requested
confirmation, forms, documentation or other information.

(e) The Agent shall provide any withholding certificate, withholding statement,
documentation, authorisations and waivers it receives from a Lender pursuant
to this Clause 16.8 to the Borrower and shall be entitled to rely on any such
withholding certificate, withholding statement, documentation, authorisations
and waivers provided without further verification. The Agent shall not be liable
for any action taken by it under or in connection with this paragraph (e).

(f) Each Lender agrees that if any withholding certificate, withholding statement,
documentation, authorisations and waivers provided to the Agent pursuant to
this Clause 16.8 is or becomes materially inaccurate or incomplete, it shall
promptly update such withholding certificate, withholding statement,
documentation, authorisations and waivers unless it is unlawful for it to do so,
in which case the Lender shall promptly notify the Agent in writing of its legal
inability to do so. The Agent shall provide any such updated withholding
certificate, withholding statement, documentation, authorisations and waivers
to the Borrower. The Agent shall not be liable for any action taken by it under
or in connection with this paragraph (f).

16.9 **FATCA Deduction**

(a) Each Party may make any FATCA Deduction it is required to make by FATCA,
and any payment required in connection with that FATCA Deduction, and no
Party shall be required to increase any payment in respect of which it makes
such a FATCA Deduction or otherwise compensate the recipient of the payment
for that FATCA Deduction.

(b) Each Party shall promptly, upon becoming aware that it must make a FATCA
Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of such FATCA
Deduction) notify the Party to whom it is making the payment and, in addition,


-----

shall notify the Company and the Agent and the Agent shall promptly notify the
other Finance Parties.

Agent as a consequence of taking or holding the Transaction Security or enforcing these
rights.

21. **GUARANTEES AND INDEMNITY**

21.1 **Guarantee and indemnity**

Subject to any applicable limitation provided under this Clause 21 (Guarantees and
_Indemnity) or any Accession Deed, each Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally_
jointly and severally by way of an independent guarantee:

(a) guarantees to each Finance Party punctual performance by each other Obligor
of all that Obligor’s obligations under the Finance Documents;

(b) undertakes with each Finance Party that whenever another Obligor does not pay
any amount when due (allowing for any applicable grace period) under or in
connection with any Finance Document, that Guarantor shall immediately on
demand pay that amount as if it was the principal obligor; and

(c) agrees with each Finance Party that if any obligation guaranteed by it is or
becomes unenforceable, invalid or illegal, it will, as an independent and primary
obligation, indemnify that Finance Party immediately on demand against any
cost, loss or liability it incurs as a result of an Obligor not paying any amount
which would, but for such unenforceability, invalidity or illegality, have been
payable by it under any Finance Document on the date when it would have been
due.


-----

The amount payable by a Guarantor under this indemnity will not exceed the amount it
would have had to pay under this Clause 21 if the amount claimed had been recoverable
on the basis of a guarantee.

21.2 **Continuing Guarantee**

This guarantee is a continuing guarantee and will extend to the ultimate balance of sums
payable by any Obligor under the Finance Documents, regardless of any intermediate
payment or discharge in whole or in part.

21.3 **Reinstatement**

If any discharge, release or arrangement (whether in respect of the obligations of any
Obligor or any security for those obligations or otherwise) is made by a Finance Party
in whole or in part on the basis of any payment, security or other disposition which is
avoided or must be restored in insolvency, liquidation, administration or otherwise,
without limitation, then the liability of each Guarantor under this Clause 21 will
continue or be reinstated as if the discharge, release or arrangement had not occurred.

21.4 **Waiver of defences**

Subject to any limitation provided under this Clause 21 (Guarantee and Indemnity) or
any Accession Deed, the obligations of each Guarantor under this Clause 21 will not be
affected by an act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this Clause 21, would
reduce, release or prejudice any of its obligations under this Clause 21, (without
limitation and whether or not known to it or any Finance Party) including:

(a) any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any Obligor or
other person;

(b) the release of any other Obligor or any other person under the terms of any
composition or arrangement with any creditor of any member of the Group;

(c) the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or release of, or refusal or
neglect to perfect, take up or enforce, any rights against, or security over assets
of, any Obligor or other person or any non-presentation or non-observance of
any formality or other requirement in respect of any instrument or any failure to
realise the full value of any security;

(d) any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of or dissolution
or change in the members or status of an Obligor or any other person;

(e) any amendment, novation, supplement, extension restatement (however
fundamental and whether or not more onerous) or replacement of a Finance
Document or any other document or security including, without limitation, any
change in the purpose of, any extension of or increase in any facility or the
addition of any new facility under any Finance Document or other document or
security;

(f) any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity of any obligation of any person
under any Finance Document or any other document or security; or


-----

(g) any insolvency or similar proceedings.

21.5 **Guarantor Intent**

Without prejudice to the generality of Clause 21.4 (Waiver of defences) but subject to
the guarantee limitations set out in Clause 21.11 (Guarantee limitation), each Guarantor
expressly confirms that it intends that this guarantee shall extend from time to time to
any (however fundamental) variation, increase, extension or addition of or to any of the
Finance Documents and/or any facility or amount made available under any of the
Finance Documents for the purposes of or in connection with any of the following:
business acquisitions of any nature; increasing working capital; enabling investor
distributions to be made; carrying out restructurings; refinancing existing facilities;
refinancing any other indebtedness; making facilities available to new borrowers; any
other variation or extension of the purposes for which any such facility or amount might
be made available from time to time; and any fees, costs and/or expenses associated
with any of the foregoing.

21.6 **Immediate recourse**

Each Guarantor waives any right it may have of first requiring any Finance Party (or
any trustee or agent on its behalf) to proceed against or enforce any other rights or
security or claim payment from any person before claiming from that Guarantor under
this Clause 21. This waiver applies irrespective of any law or any provision of a Finance
Document to the contrary.

21.7 **Appropriations**

Without prejudice to the other provisions of this Agreement, until all amounts which
may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance
Documents have been irrevocably paid in full, each Finance Party (or any trustee or
agent on its behalf) may:

(a) refrain from applying or enforcing any other moneys, security or rights held or
received by that Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect
of those amounts, or apply and enforce the same in such manner and order as it
sees fit (whether against those amounts or otherwise) and no Guarantor shall be
entitled to the benefit of the same; and

(b) hold in an interest bearing suspense account any moneys received from any
Guarantor on account of any Guarantor’s liability under this Clause 21.

21.8 **Deferral of Guarantors’ rights**

Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in
connection with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full and unless
the Agent otherwise directs, no Guarantor will exercise any rights which it may have
by reason of performance by it of its obligations under the Finance Documents or by
reason of any amount being payable, or liability arising, under this Clause 21:

(a) to be indemnified by an Obligor;


-----

(b) to claim any contribution from any other guarantor of any Obligor’s obligations
under the Finance Documents;

(c) to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or
otherwise) of any rights of the Finance Parties under the Finance Documents or
of any other guarantee or security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, the
Finance Documents by any Finance Party;

(d) to bring legal or other proceedings for an order requiring any Obligor to make
any payment, or perform any obligation, in respect of which any Guarantor has
given a guarantee, undertaking or indemnity under Clause 21.1 (Guarantee and
_indemnity);_

(e) to exercise any right of set off against any Obligor; and/or

(f) to claim or prove as a creditor of any Obligor in competition with any Finance
Party other than to preserve its rights or claims.

If a Guarantor receives any benefit, payment or distribution in relation to such rights it
shall hold that benefit, payment or distribution to the extent necessary to enable all
amounts which may be or become payable to the Finance Parties by the Obligors under
or in connection with the Finance Documents to be repaid in full on trust for the Finance
Parties and shall promptly pay or transfer the same to the Agent or as the Agent may
direct for application in accordance with Clause 33 (Payment Mechanics).

21.9 **Release of Guarantors’ right of contribution**

If any Guarantor (a “Retiring Guarantor”) ceases to be a Guarantor in accordance
with the terms of the Finance Documents for the purpose of any sale or other disposal
of that Retiring Guarantor or any of its Holding Companies then on the date such
Retiring Guarantor ceases to be a Guarantor:

(a) that Retiring Guarantor is released by each other Guarantor from any liability
(whether past, present or future and whether actual or contingent) to make a
contribution to any other Guarantor arising by reason of the performance by any
other Guarantor of its obligations under the Finance Documents; and

(b) each other Guarantor waives any rights it may have by reason of the
performance of its obligations under the Finance Documents to take the benefit
(in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any
rights of the Finance Parties under any Finance Document or of any other
security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, any Finance Document where
such rights or security are granted by or in relation to the assets of the Retiring
Guarantor.

21.10 **Additional security**

This guarantee is in addition to and is not in any way prejudiced by any other guarantee
or security now or subsequently held by any Finance Party.

21.11 **Guarantee limitation**

(a) Without limiting any specific exemptions set out below:

(i) no Guarantor’s obligations and liabilities under this Clause 21 and under
any other guarantee or indemnity provision in a Finance Document (the
“Guarantee Obligations”) will extend to include any obligation or
liability; and

(ii) no Transaction Security granted by a Guarantor will secure any
Guarantee Obligation,

if to the extent doing so would be unlawful financial assistance (notwithstanding
any applicable exemptions and/or undertaking of any applicable prescribed
whitewash or similar financial assistance procedures) in respect of the
acquisition of shares in itself or its Holding Company or a member of the Group
under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation.

(b) Notwithstanding anything set out to the contrary in this Agreement or any other
Finance Document to the contrary (but without prejudice to compliance with
the Guarantor Coverage Test), the obligations and liabilities of any member of
the Group (which is a Guarantor under this Clause 21 or any other provision of
this Agreement or any other Finance Document to which it is a party) in its
capacity as a Guarantor, shall be limited in accordance with any limitation
imposed by any applicable legal or regulatory requirement.

(c) If, notwithstanding paragraph (a) above, the giving of the guarantee in respect
of the Guarantee Obligations or Transaction Security would be unlawful
financial assistance, then, to the extent necessary to give effect to paragraph (a)
above, the obligations under the Finance Documents will be deemed to have
been split into two tranches:

(i) **Tranche 1 comprising those obligations which can be secured by the**
Guarantee Obligations or Transaction Security without breaching or
contravening relevant financial assistance laws; and

(ii) **Tranche 2 comprising the remainder of the obligations under the**
Finance Documents.

The Tranche 2 obligations will be excluded from the relevant Guarantee
Obligations.

21.12 **Additional guarantee limitations**

The guarantee of any Additional Guarantor is subject to any limitations relating to that
Additional Guarantor on the amount guaranteed or to the extent of the recourse of the
beneficiaries of the guarantee which is set out in the Accession Deed applicable to such
Additional Guarantor and agreed with the Agent (acting reasonably in accordance with
the Agreed Security Principles).

giving a true and fair view of the financial condition of the Group.

(c) The Company shall ensure that each Budget delivered to the Agent pursuant to
this Agreement shall:

(i) include a projected consolidated profit and loss statement and cashflow

Financial Statements delivered under this Agreement.

required to deliver a Compliance Certificate under this Agreement until the date
on which the Quarterly Financial Statements or Annual Financial Statements

to provide a Compliance Certificate before that date.


-----

(e) The Company may, but is not obliged to, supply a Compliance Certificate in
respect of any Quarter Period, prior to the first time it is required to supply a
Compliance Certificate, in order to benefit from a reduction in Margin in

to the Accounting Principles, be accompanied by a certificate from the Auditors
confirming the basis for such changes and the calculations and adjustments and

reasonable and properly incurred fees of the Finance Parties’ professional advisers and
**provided that those costs are subject to prior notification to the Company and where**
such costs are notified to be in aggregate greater than £250,000 then subject to the prior
consent of the Company):

(a) access (in the presence of the Obligors’ Agent) at all reasonable times and on
reasonable notice to the books, accounts and records of each member of the

(current or pending) affecting it or any of its Subsidiaries, including the details
of any claim, notice or other communication received by it, which is reasonably

would, if so adversely determined be reasonably expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect;

documents or material information dispatched by any Obligor to its creditors
generally (or any class of them) and, following a Listing, to its shareholders

of the terms used therein as are necessary to give the Lenders
comparable protection to that contemplated at the date of this Agreement

to ensure that the adoption by the Group of such different accounting
basis does not result in any material alteration in the commercial effect
of the obligations of the Obligors’ Agent, the Parent or any Obligor in
the Finance Documents;

(iv) if amendments satisfactory to the Majority Lenders (acting reasonably
and in accordance with the provisions of this Clause 23.6) are agreed by

without the prior written consent of the Agent (acting on the instructions of the
Majority Lenders) (in which event the Agent may require such changes to the
financial covenants set out in Clause 24 (Financial Covenants) as will fairly
reflect such change) **provided that the consent of the Agent (acting on the**
instructions of the Majority Lenders) shall not be required to any such change
where:

(i) the Accounting Reference Date is changed to another Quarter Date and
no Financial Year is longer than 12 Months; or

instructions of the Majority Lenders (acting reasonably and in
accordance with the provisions of this Clause 23.6)) with regard
to Financial Year based general baskets, exceptions and
permissions, in each case which places the Lenders in no worse
position as a result of such change than they would have been in
if no change under this Clause 23.6 had taken place,

determination under this Agreement (including on a _pro forma basis and_
including for the purposes of determining any interest rate), the exchange rates

otherwise) has made or committed to make an acquisition of any
person that thereby becomes a Subsidiary or otherwise has
acquired or committed to acquire any entity, business, property
or material fixed asset (including the acquisition, opening and/or
development of any new site or operation) (any such investment,
acquisition or commitment therefor, a “Purchase”, and the asset
which is the subject of any Purchase, a “Purchased Asset”),
including any such Purchase occurring in connection with a
transaction causing a calculation to be made under this
Agreement or the other Finance Documents, calculate
Consolidated EBITDA for such period on the basis that the
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation
(calculated on the same basis as Consolidated EBITDA, mutatis
_mutandis) attributable to the assets which are the subject of such_
Purchase during such Relevant Period are included in
Consolidated EBITDA as if the Purchase occurred on the first
day of such Relevant Period provided that, in the event that a
Purchased Asset has negative earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation on a standalone reported basis of
more than £1,000,000 or, if higher, an amount equal to 2.5 per
cent. of Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA, the word “may” in
paragraph (e)(i) above shall be deemed to read “shall” in relation
to such Purchased Asset (but not otherwise); and

amount of the _pro forma increase in Consolidated EBITDA_
projected by the Company (in good faith) after taking into
account the full run rate effect of all synergies, cost savings,
operating expense reductions, operating improvements or other
similar initiatives which the CEO, CFO or other authorised
signatory (in good faith) reasonably believes can be achieved
from the date of the Purchase to the date falling 18 Months
following the date of completion of the Purchase (or, if later, the
last day of the applicable Relevant Period) directly or indirectly
as a result of the Purchase or the related steps provided that so
long as such synergies, cost savings, operating expense
reductions, operating improvements or other similar initiatives
will be realisable at any time during such period, it may be
assumed they will be realisable during the entire such period
without prejudice to the synergies, cost savings, operating
expense reductions, operating improvements or other similar
initiatives actually realised during the Relevant Period and
already included in Consolidated EBITDA (the “Pro Forma
**Acquisition Cost Savings”); and**

(C) exclude any non-recurring fees, costs and expenses directly or
indirectly related to the Purchase; and


-----

(ii) when determining (or, as applicable, forecasting) Consolidated
EBITDA for any Relevant Period (including the portion thereof
occurring prior to any relevant Sale (as defined below)), the Company:

(A) shall, if during such period any member of the Group has
transferred or disposed or committed to make a transfer or
disposal of any entity or business (any such sale, transfer,
disposition or commitment therefor, a “Sale”) or if the
transaction giving rise to the need to calculate Consolidated
EBITDA relates to such a Sale, calculate Consolidated EBITDA
for such period on the basis that Consolidated EBITDA will be
(i) reduced by an amount equal to the earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation, amortisation and impairment (calculated on
the same basis as Consolidated EBITDA, mutatis mutandis) (if
positive) attributable to the assets which are the subject of such
Sale for such period or (ii) increased by an amount equal to the
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and
impairment (calculated on the same basis as Consolidated
EBITDA, mutatis mutandis) (if negative) attributable thereto for
such period as if the Sale occurred on the first day of such
Relevant Period; and/or

(B) may include an adjustment in respect of any Sale up to the
amount of the _pro forma increase in Consolidated EBITDA_
projected by the Company (in good faith) after taking into
account the full run rate effect of all synergies, cost savings,
operating expense reductions, operating improvements or other
similar initiatives which the CEO, CFO or other authorised
signatory (in good faith) reasonably believes can be achieved
from the date of the Sale to the date falling 18 Months following
the date of completion of the Sale directly or indirectly as a
consequence of the Sale, or the related steps provided that so
long as such synergies, cost savings, operating expense
reductions, operating improvements or other similar initiatives
will be realisable at any time during such period, it may be
assumed they will be realisable during the entire such period
without prejudice to the synergies, cost savings, operating
expense reductions, operating improvements or other similar
initiatives actually realised during the Relevant Period and
already included in Consolidated EBITDA (the “Pro Forma
**Disposal Cost Savings”); and/or**

(C) may exclude any non-recurring fees, costs and expenses directly
or indirectly related to the Sale; and/or

(iii) when determining (or, as applicable, forecasting) Consolidated
EBITDA for any Relevant Period (including the portion thereof
occurring prior to implementing or committing to implement any
relevant Group Initiative (as defined below)), the Company may:


-----

(A) if during such period any member of the Group has entered into
a new contract or undertaken, any restructuring, cost saving or
similar initiative, (each contract, restructuring, cost saving or
similar initiative, a “Group Initiative”) including any such
Group Initiative occurring in connection with a transaction
causing a calculation to be made under this Agreement or the
other Finance Documents, calculate Consolidated EBITDA for
such period on the basis that the earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (calculated on the same basis as
Consolidated EBITDA, _mutatis mutandis) attributable to the_
Group Initiative during such Relevant Period as if the Group
Initiative occurred on the first day of such Relevant Period;
and/or

(B) include an adjustment in respect of each Group Initiative up to
the amount of the pro forma increase in Consolidated EBITDA
projected by the Company (in good faith) after taking into
account the full run rate effect of all synergies, cost savings,
revenues, operating expense reductions, operating
improvements or other adjustments or similar initiatives which
the CEO, CFO or other authorised signatory (in good faith)
reasonably believes can be achieved from the date of the Group
Initiative to the date falling 18 Months following the date of
completion of the Group Initiative directly or indirectly as a
result of implementing or committing to implement such Group
Initiative provided that so long as such synergies, cost savings,
revenues, operating expense reductions, operating
improvements or other similar initiatives will be realisable at any
time during such period, it may be assumed they will be
realisable during the entire period without prejudice to the
synergies, cost savings, revenues, operating expense reductions,
operating improvements or other similar initiatives actually
realised during the Relevant Period and already included in
Consolidated EBITDA (the “Pro Forma Group Initiative Cost
**Savings”); and/or**

(C) exclude any non-recurring fees, costs and expenses directly or
indirectly related to the implementation of, or commitment to,
implements such Group Initiative.

(f) In relation to the definitions set out in Clause 24.1 (Financial definitions) and
all other related provisions of the Finance Documents (including this Clause 24)
all calculations in respect of Pro Forma Adjustments (in each case actual or
anticipated) may be made as though the full run-rate effect of such Pro Forma
Adjustments were realised on the first day of the Relevant Period provided that
where any Pro Forma Adjustments are included in any calculation in respect of
any Purchase, Sale or Group Initiative:

(i) such Pro Forma Adjustment must be certified in writing by the CEO,
the CFO or other authorised signatory of the Company to the Agent as


-----

being reasonably anticipated and achievable, together with details of
such items and supporting calculations;

(ii) if each projected (but not realised) _Pro Forma Adjustment is greater_
than 15 per cent. of Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA (excluding the
impact of such adjustment) in any Relevant Period, an accountancy firm
or industry specialist (or such other firm approved by the Majority
Lenders) (acting reasonably) has commented that such _Pro Forma_
Adjustments are not unreasonable (which may be provided for in any
accompanying accountants or industry specialists’ due diligence
reports); and

(iii) the aggregate amount of projected (but not realised) _Pro Forma_
Adjustments that may be included in any Relevant Period may not
exceed 25 per cent. of Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA (excluding the
impact of such adjustments) for such period.

(g) In the event that Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA is required to be calculated
for any purposes under this Agreement prior to the date falling 12 Months after
the Closing Date, Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA may be calculated (at the
Company’s election) by reference to Consolidated _Pro Forma EBITDA as_
determined on an actual basis over the Relevant Period.

(h) In the event that Consolidated Total Net Cash Interest Expense is to be
calculated on a date falling prior to the end of the fourth complete Financial
Quarter after the Closing Date, Consolidated Total Net Cash Interest Expense
in respect of the period falling after the Closing Date shall be calculated as
follows:

A/B × 12

where:

A = the aggregate Consolidated Total Net Cash Interest Expense for
each complete month commencing after the Closing Date to the
end of the relevant testing period; and

B = the number of complete months commencing after the Closing
Date to the end of the relevant testing period.

(i) In the event that:

(i) any Accounting Reference Date is adjusted by the Obligors’ Agent to
avoid an Accounting Reference Date falling on a day which is not a
Business Day and/or to ensure that an Accounting Reference Date falls
on a particular day of the week; or

(ii) there is any adjustment to a scheduled payment date to avoid payments
becoming due on a day which is not a Business Day,


-----

if that adjustment results in any amount being paid in a Relevant Period in which
it would otherwise not have been paid, for the purpose of calculating any
Testing Metric under the Finance Documents the Obligors’ Agent may treat
such amount as if it was paid in the Relevant Period in which it would have been
paid save for any such adjustment.

(j) Unless a contrary indication appears, a reference in the Finance Documents to
Consolidated EBITDA is to be construed as a reference to the Consolidated
EBITDA of the Group on a consolidated basis.

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (including anything in the financial
definitions set out in this Agreement), when calculating any Testing Metric, the
financial definitions or component thereof but excluding Excess Cash Flow, the
Company shall be permitted to:

(i) exclude all or any part of any expenditure or other negative item (and/or
the impact thereof) directly or indirectly relating to or resulting from:

(A) the Transaction;

(B) any Permitted Acquisition, investment or Permitted Joint
Venture or Permitted Transaction not prohibited by the terms of
this Agreement or the impact from purchase price accounting;

(C) (other than in relation to the calculation of Consolidated
Cashflow and Consolidated Total Net Debt) start-up costs for
new businesses and branding or re-branding of existing
businesses;

(D) (other than in relation to the calculation of Consolidated
Cashflow and Consolidated Total Net Debt) Restructuring Costs;

(E) [Reserved]; and/or

(F) the implementation of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with
Customers) and any successor standard thereto (or any
equivalent measure under the Accounting Principles); and/or

(ii) include any addbacks (without further verification or diligence) for
adjustments (including anticipated synergies) or costs or expenses
(A) reflected in the Base Case Model, the Reports (excluding the Tax
Structure Memorandum) and/or any quality of earnings report provided
to the Backstop Lender prior to the date of this Agreement and/or
(B) taken into account in determining structuring EBITDA.

(l) For the purpose of this Clause 24 and to the extent the Leverage Ratio or any
financial definition contained in this Clause 24 is used as the basis (in whole or
in part) for permitting any transaction or making any determination under this
Agreement (including on a _pro forma basis) no item shall be included or_
excluded more than once where to do so would result in double counting.

_other obligations) (and no Default shall be deemed to have occurred) if, by no_
later than the date falling 20 Business Days after the date on which the

copies of each Press Release, each Offer Document, each Scheme Document
and any other material legally binding agreement entered into by the Company
in connection with an Offer or a Scheme to the extent material to the interests
of the Lenders (as reasonably determined by the Company) and promptly
provide the Agent with such information it may reasonably request in writing
as to the status and progress of the Scheme or the Offer (including, in the case
of an Offer, the current level of acceptances, the implementation and exercise
of the Squeeze-Out Rights and the dispatch of any Squeeze-Out Notices (if
relevant) but excluding, in the case of a Scheme, the current level of proxies
received and notified to the Target in respect of the Scheme and any other
information not freely supplied by the Target), any regulatory and anti-trust

(f) The Company will not take any action, and procure that none of its Affiliates
nor any person acting in concert with it (within the meaning of the Takeover
Code) takes any action, which would require it to make a mandatory offer for
the Target Shares in accordance with Rule 9 of the Takeover Code or which


-----

would require a change to be made to the terms of the Scheme or the Offer (as
the case may be), including pursuant to Rule 6 or Rule 11 of the Takeover Code
which change, if made voluntarily, would be a Materially Adverse Amendment.

(g) The Company will not, prior to the issuance of the relevant Press Release, at
any time (including following the Offer Unconditional Date or the Scheme
Effective Date) make any public announcement or public statement (other than
in the relevant Press Release or Acquisition Document) concerning this

unless required to do so by the Takeover Code, the Panel, the Applicable Court,
any regulation, any applicable stock exchange or any applicable governmental

Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Lenders and such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless required to do so by law or
regulation or by the Takeover Code, the Panel or the Applicable Court. In
addition, the Company shall not issue any Press Release that contains the name
of any Lender without the prior written consent of such Lender (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless required to do
so by the Takeover Code, the Panel, the Applicable Court, any regulation, any
applicable stock exchange or any applicable governmental or other regulatory
authority.

(h) The Company will not, in the case of an Offer, (i) declare the Offer

applicable listing rules with regards to the obligations set out in this paragraph
(i), in the case of a Scheme, within 30 days after the Scheme Effective Date and,

(directly or indirectly) owns Target Shares (excluding any shares held in
treasury) which represent not less than 75 per cent. of all Target Shares
(excluding any shares held in treasury), procure that such action as is necessary
is taken to apply for the cancellation of trading in the Target Shares on the

Group’s business (or to an Affiliate of such person or a
person acting on behalf, on the instructions of or for the
account of such person); and

(3) any person that is (or would, upon becoming a Lender,
be) a Defaulting Lender; and

(E) if the Transfer is in respect of an Additional Facility, the
restrictions (if any) specified in the relevant Additional Facility
Notice establishing such Additional Facility Commitments are
complied with.

(c) Without prejudice to Clause 2.6 (Alternative Facility B Lenders), on or prior to
the end of the Certain Funds Period, the prior written consent of the Obligors’
Agent (in its sole discretion) is required for any Transfer.

(d) Any request for consent of the Obligors’ Agent pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (c)
(inclusive) above and related communications shall be delivered simultaneously
to the Sponsor.

(e) An assignment or transfer of part of a Lender’s Commitments shall be (when
aggregated with all simultaneous transfers by Affiliates and Related Funds) in
a minimum amount of:

(i) £1,000,000 in respect of the Original Revolving Facility, and unless set
out to the contrary in the relevant Additional Facility Notice, any
Additional Revolving Facility;

(ii) £1,000,000 in respect of Facility B (other than in respect of any
assignment or transfer by a Lender to any of its Affiliates and Related
Funds for which no minimum shall apply **provided that the other**
provisions of this Agreement are complied with for the purpose of such
assignment or transfer);

(iii) [Reserved]; or

(iv) £1,000,000 in respect of the Acquisition / Capex Facility (other than in
respect of any assignment or transfer by a Lender to any of its Affiliates
and Related Funds for which no minimum shall apply provided that the


-----

other provisions of this Agreement are complied with for the purpose of
such assignment or transfer),

and, in each case, in integral multiples of £1,000,000 and in an amount such that
the Lender’s remaining Commitment (when aggregated with its Affiliates’ and
Related Funds’ Commitments) is in a minimum amount of:

(A) £2,000,000 in respect of the Original Revolving Facility, and
unless set out to the contrary in the relevant Additional Facility
Notice, any Additional Revolving Facility;

(B) £5,000,000 in respect of Facility B;

(C) [Reserved];

(D) £2,500,000 in respect of the Acquisition / Capex Facility,

(E) or, in each case, where the Lender is transferring all of its
Commitments under a Facility, zero, provided that:

(1) if an Existing Lender is a fund, it may assign its rights to
(and its corresponding obligations may be released and
equivalent obligations acceded to by) another fund that is
either an Existing Lender or a related fund of a fund that
is an Existing Lender in any amount; and

(2) in the case of concurrent assignments, release and
accessions by an Existing Lender to two or more related
funds, the Commitments of these related funds shall, at
the option of the relevant Lender(s), be aggregated.

(f) The Obligors’ Agent and the Agent (acting on the instructions of all the Lenders)
may agree an amendment of the Approved List once per calendar year provided
**that the Obligors’ Agent may, without the agreement of the Agent or any other**
Finance Party, replace up to five institutions (other than any Original Lender or
any of its Affiliates at that time) on the Approved List, in each case, with another
institution of a similar type. The Approved List may not, in any event, include
(directly or indirectly) or be deemed to include any distressed debt fund, loanto-own fund or other equity fund (whether or not related to, or an Affiliate of,
any person set out in the Approved List).

(g) Any Transfer referred to in paragraph (c) above, and the identity of the proposed
New Lender (or, as the case may be, sub-participant or sub-contractor) shall be
notified separately to the Obligors’ Agent and to the Sponsor by the Agent
promptly before the Closing Date and the Obligors’ Agent shall be entitled to
information that the Obligors’ Agent may reasonably request from the Agent
regarding the identity and participations of that New Lender.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any other Finance
Document, any Assignment Agreement or any Transfer Certificate, if an
Original Lender transfers any or all of its Commitments in Facility B, the


-----

Acquisition / Capex Facility and/or the Original Revolving Facility to a New
Lender (including an Affiliate or Related Fund) on or prior to the end of the
Certain Funds Period (the “Pre-Closing Transferred Commitments”) then
**provided that the Lenders are obliged to comply with Clause 5.4 (Lenders’**
_participation) pursuant to Clause 4.5 (Utilisations during a Certain Funds_
_Period) in relation to a Utilisation requested by a Borrower (or the Obligors’_
Agent on its behalf) in a Utilisation Request in respect of Facility B, the
Acquisition / Capex Facility and/or the Original Revolving Facility, that
Original Lender shall remain obliged to fund and, subject to Clause 4.5
(Utilisations during a Certain Funds Period), will fund the Pre-Closing
Transferred Commitments in respect of that Utilisation if that New Lender has
failed to so fund (or has confirmed that it will not be able to fund) on any
Utilisation Date on or prior to the end of the Certain Funds Period in respect of
the relevant Facility or Facilities in circumstances where such New Lender is
contractually obliged to do so under this Agreement.

(i) An assignment or transfer under this Clause 27 will only be effective upon:

(i) receipt by the Agent (in the Assignment Agreement or otherwise) of
written confirmation from the New Lender (in form and substance
satisfactory to the Agent) that it will assume the same obligations to each
of the other Finance Parties and the other Secured Parties as it would
have been under had it been an Original Lender;

(ii) the New Lender entering into the documentation required for it to accede
as a party to the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(iii) performance by the Agent of all “know your customer” or other similar
checks under all applicable laws and regulations relating to any person
that the Agent is required to carry out in relation to such assignment or
transfer to a New Lender, the completion of which the Agent shall
promptly notify to the Existing Lender and the New Lender.

(j) A transfer will only be effective if the New Lender enters into the
documentation required for it to accede as a party to the Intercreditor Agreement
if the procedure set out in Clause 27.7 (Procedure for transfer) is complied with.

(k) If:

(i) a Lender Transfers any of its rights or obligations under the Finance
Documents or changes its Facility Office or lending office or branch;
and

(ii) as a result of circumstances existing at the date of the Transfer or other
change, the Parent or an Obligor (as applicable) would be obliged to
make a payment to the New Lender or Lender acting through its new
Facility Office, lending office or branch under Clause 16 (Taxes), Clause
17 (Increased Costs) or Clause 18 (Other Indemnities),

then the New Lender or Lender acting through its new Facility Office, branch
or lending office is not entitled to receive a payment under those Clauses to the


-----

extent such payment would be greater than the payment that would have been
made to the Existing Lender or Lender acting through its previous Facility
Office lending office or branch had the Transfer or other change not occurred.
This paragraph (k) shall not apply, in respect of Clause 16.2 (Tax gross-up), to
a Treaty Lender that has included a confirmation of its scheme reference number
and its jurisdiction of tax residence in accordance with paragraph (h)(ii) or (iii)
of Clause 16.2 (Tax gross-up) if the Obligor making the payment has not made
a Borrower DTTP Filing in respect of that Treaty Lender.

(l) Each New Lender, by executing the relevant Transfer Certificate or Assignment
Agreement, confirms, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Agent has authority
to execute on its behalf any amendment or waiver that has been approved by or
on behalf of the requisite Lender or Lenders in accordance with this Agreement
on or prior to the date on which the transfer or assignment becomes effective in
accordance with this Agreement and that it is bound by that decision to the same
extent as the Existing Lender would have been had it remained a Lender.

(m) If any Transfer occurs in breach of the provisions of this Clause 27, that Transfer
shall not be effective and shall be void, and the related commitments and
participations shall not be included when ascertaining whether a certain
percentage of total Commitments and/or participations has been obtained to an
amendment or waiver.

(n) Notwithstanding any other provision of any Finance Document, the Obligors
shall not bear any taxes, notarial and security registration or perfection fees,
costs, expenses, gross-up or increased costs that result from Transfer of a
Lender’s participation.

27.4 **Assignments by Lenders**

Upon an assignment becoming effective, the Existing Lender will be released from its
obligations under the Finance Documents to the extent they are assumed by the New
Lender.

27.5 **Assignment or transfer fee**

Unless the assignment or transfer is made by an Existing Lender to an Affiliate or
Related Fund, in each case, of such Existing Lender or unless the Agent agrees
otherwise and excluding an assignment or transfer made in connection with primary
syndication of the Facilities, the New Lender shall, on or before the date upon which
an assignment or transfer to it takes effect pursuant to this Clause 27, pay to the Agent
(for its own account) a fee of £2,500.

27.6 **Limitation of responsibility of Existing Lenders**

(a) Unless expressly agreed to the contrary, an Existing Lender makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility to a New Lender for:

(i) the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of the
Transaction Documents, the Transaction Security or any other
documents;


-----

(ii) the financial condition of any Obligor or any other member of the Group;

(iii) the performance and observance by any Obligor or any other member of
the Group of its obligations under the Transaction Documents or any
other documents; or

(iv) the accuracy of any statements or information (whether written or oral)
made or supplied in connection with any Transaction Document or any
other document,

and any representations or warranties implied by law are excluded.

(b) Each New Lender confirms to the Existing Lender and the other Finance Parties
and the Secured Parties that it:

(i) has made (and shall continue to make) its own independent investigation
and assessment of the financial condition and affairs of the Company
and each other Obligor and its related entities and all other risks arising
in connection with its participation in the Finance Documents and has
not relied exclusively on any information provided to it by the Existing
Lender or any other Finance Party in connection with any Transaction
Document or the Transaction Security; and

(ii) will continue to make its own independent appraisal of the
creditworthiness of the Company and each other Obligor and its related
entities whilst any amount is or may be outstanding under the Finance
Documents or any Commitment is in force.

(c) Nothing in any Finance Document obliges an Existing Lender to:

(i) accept a re-transfer or re assignment from a New Lender of any of the
rights and obligations assigned or transferred by such Existing Lender
under this Clause 27; or

(ii) support any losses directly or indirectly incurred by the New Lender by
reason of the non-performance by any Obligor of its obligations under
the Transaction Documents or otherwise.

27.7 **Procedure for transfer**

(a) Subject to the conditions set out in Clause 27.3 (Conditions of assignment or
_transfer) and Clause 39.4 (Replacement of Finance Party), a transfer by_
novation is effected in accordance with paragraph (e) below of this Clause 27.7
when the Agent executes an otherwise duly completed Transfer Certificate
executed and delivered to it by the Existing Lender and the New Lender.

(b) The Agent shall, subject to paragraph (c) below, as soon as reasonably
practicable after receipt by it of a duly completed Transfer Certificate appearing
on its face to comply with the terms of this Agreement and delivered in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, execute that Transfer Certificate.


-----

(c) The Agent shall only be obliged to execute a Transfer Certificate delivered to it
by the Existing Lender and the New Lender once it is satisfied it has complied
with all necessary “know your customer” or other similar checks under all
applicable laws and regulations in relation to the transfer to such New Lender.

(d) Each party to this Agreement (other than the Existing Lender and the New
Lender) irrevocably authorises the Agent to execute any duly completed
Transfer Certificate on its behalf.

(e) On the Transfer Date:

(i) to the extent that in such Transfer Certificate the Existing Lender seeks
to transfer by novation its rights and obligations under the Finance
Documents and in respect of the Transaction Security, each of the
Obligors and the Parent and such Existing Lender shall be released from
further obligations towards one another (and the Existing Lender shall
be released from any further obligations toward each other) under the
Finance Documents and in respect of the Transaction Security and their
respective rights against one another under the Finance Documents and
in respect of the Transaction Security shall be cancelled (such rights and
obligations being referred to in this Clause 27.7 as “discharged rights
**and obligations”);**

(ii) each of the Obligors and the Parent and the New Lender shall assume
obligations towards one another and/or acquire rights against one
another which differ from the discharged rights and obligations only
insofar as that Obligor or other member of the Group and that New
Lender have assumed and/or acquired the same in place of that Obligor
and such Existing Lender;

(iii) the Agent, the Backstop Lender, the New Lender and the other Finance
Parties shall acquire the same rights and benefits and assume the same
obligations between themselves as they would have acquired and
assumed had such New Lender been an original party hereto as a Lender
with the rights, benefits and/or obligations acquired or assumed by it as
a result of such transfer and to that extent the Agent, the Backstop
Lender and the relevant Existing Lender and the other Finance Parties
(other than the New Lender) shall each be released from further
obligations to each other under the Finance Documents; and

(iv) such New Lender shall become a party hereto as a Lender.

27.8 **Procedure for assignment**

(a) Subject to the conditions set out in Clause 27.3 (Conditions of assignment or
_transfer) and Clause 39.4 (Replacement of Finance Party), an assignment may_
be effected in accordance with paragraph (c) below when the Agent executes an
otherwise duly completed Assignment Agreement delivered to it by the Existing
Lender and the New Lender. The Agent shall, subject to paragraph (b) below,
as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt by it of a duly completed
Assignment Agreement appearing on its face to comply with the terms of this


-----

Agreement and delivered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
execute that Assignment Agreement.

(b) The Agent shall only be obliged to execute an Assignment Agreement delivered
to it in accordance with the provisions of this Clause once it is satisfied it has
complied with all necessary “know your customer” or similar checks under all
applicable laws and regulations in relation to the assignment to such New
Lender.

(c) On the Transfer Date:

(i) the Existing Lender will assign absolutely to the New Lender its rights
under the Finance Documents and in respect of the Transaction Security
expressed to be the subject of the assignment in the Assignment
Agreement;

(ii) the Existing Lender will be released from the obligations (the “Relevant
**Obligations”) expressed to be the subject of the release in the**
Assignment Agreement (and any corresponding obligations by which it
is bound in respect of the Transaction Security); and

(iii) the New Lender shall become a party as a “Lender” and will be bound
by obligations equivalent to the Relevant Obligations.

27.9 **Sub-participation**

(a) In relation to any sub-participation other than with an Affiliate, subject to Clause
27.3 (Conditions of assignment or transfer), nothing in this Agreement shall
restrict the ability of a Lender to sub-participate any or all of its obligations
hereunder so long as:

(i) such Lender shall promptly notify the Obligors’ Agent of any subparticipation entered into by it;

(ii) if, as a result of laws or regulations in force or known to be coming into
force at the time of the sub-participation, an Obligor would be obliged
to make payment to the Lender of any amount required to be paid by an
Obligor under Clause 16 (Taxes) or Clause 17 (Increased Costs), that
Lender shall not be entitled to receive or claim any amount under those
Clauses in excess of the amount that it would have been entitled to
receive or claim if that sub-participation had not occurred;

(iii) such Lender remains liable under this Agreement in relation to those
obligations and retains exclusive control over all rights and obligations
in relation to the participations and Commitments that are the subject of
the relevant agreement or arrangement, including all voting and similar
rights (for the avoidance of doubt, free of any agreement or
understanding pursuant to which it is required to or will consult with any
other person in relation to the exercise of any such rights and/or
obligations) unless the proposed sub-participant is a person to whom the
relevant rights and obligations could have been assigned or transferred


-----

in accordance with the terms of this Clause 27 and provided that, in
respect of any non-voting sub-participation, such Lender shall be
required to provide a representation to the Agent and the Obligors’
Agent on any response to a request for an amendment, waiver or other
vote made by the Lenders, that it has acted independently with respect
to such vote and has not sought or received direction from the subparticipant with respect thereto (a “Voting Confirmation”);

(iv) (subject to any confidentiality restrictions binding on the relevant
Finance Party) prior to entering into the relevant agreement or
arrangement the relevant Lender provides the Obligors’ Agent with full
details of that proposed sub-participation agreement and any voting,
consultation and other rights (directly or indirectly) to be granted to the
sub-participant;

(v) the relationship between the Lender and the proposed sub-participant is
that of a contractual debtor and creditor (including in the bankruptcy or
similar event of the Lender, an Obligor or the Parent); and

(vi) any sub-participation agreement must state that the conditions above are
applicable to further sub-participations (and such provision must be
capable of being relied upon and directly enforceable by the Obligors’
Agent against the relevant sub-participant),

and any sub-participation which occurs in breach of these provisions shall
not be effective.

(b) If a Lender does not give an affirmative Voting Confirmation when responding
to a request for an amendment, waiver or other vote, then it shall be deemed to
have provided consent to, or otherwise voted in favour of, the amendment,
waiver or other vote so requested.

27.10 **The Register**

(a) The Agent, acting for this purpose as the agent of the Company and the Obligors,

Additional Facility Lender Accession Notice or Increase Confirmation, a copy of such
document to the Obligors’ Agent within 5 Business Days of receipt of such request.

27.12 **Security over Lenders’ rights**

In addition to the other rights provided to Lenders under this Clause 27, each Lender
may without consulting with or obtaining consent from any Obligor or the Parent, at

collateral or otherwise) all or any of its rights under any Finance Document to secure
obligations of that Lender including, without limitation:

(a) any charge, assignment or other Security to secure obligations to a federal
reserve or central bank; and

(b) in the case of any Lender which is a fund, any charge, assignment or other
Security granted to any holders (or trustee or representatives of holders) of
obligations owed, or securities issued, by that Lender as security for those
obligations or securities,

except that no such charge, assignment or Security shall:

(i) release a Lender from any of its obligations under the Finance
Documents or substitute the beneficiary of the relevant charge,
assignment or other Security for the Lender as a party to any of the
Finance Documents; or


-----

(ii) require any payments to be made by an Obligor or grant to any person

28. **RESTRICTION ON DEBT PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS**

28.1 No member of the Group shall (i) enter into any Debt Purchase Transaction other than
in accordance with the other provisions of this Clause 28 or (ii) be, or beneficially own
all or any part of the share capital of an entity that is, a Lender or a party to a Debt
Purchase Transaction of the type referred to in paragraphs (b) or (c) of the definition of
“Debt Purchase Transaction”.

28.2 No Sponsor Affiliate or member of the Group may enter into any Debt Purchase
Transaction other than in accordance with the other provisions of this Clause 28.

28.3 A member of the Group, a Sponsor or Sponsor Affiliate (a “Purchaser”) may purchase
by way of assignment, pursuant to Clause 27 (Changes to the Lenders), a participation
in any Loan and any related Commitment where:

(a) such purchase is made for a consideration of less than par;

(b) such purchase is made using one of the processes set out at Clauses 28.4 and
28.5 below; and

(c) in the case of a purchase by a member of the Group, the consideration for such
purchase is funded from Acceptable Funding Sources.

28.4 Any Debt Purchase Transaction entered into by a Sponsor Affiliate or a member of the
Group shall be entered into initially pursuant to a solicitation process (a “Solicitation
**Process”) which is carried out as follows.**

(a) Prior to 11 a.m. on a given Business Day (the “Solicitation day”), the relevant
Purchaser or a financial institution acting on its behalf (the “Purchase Agent”)
will approach at the same time each Lender which participates in the relevant
Facilities to invite them to offer to sell to the relevant Purchaser, an amount of
their participation in one or more Facilities. Any Lender wishing to make such
an offer shall, by 11 a.m. on the second Business Day following such


-----

Solicitation day, communicate to the Purchase Agent details of the amount of
its participations, and in which Facilities, it is offering to sell and the price at
which it is offering to sell such participations. Any such offer shall be
irrevocable until 11 a.m. on the third Business Day following such Solicitation
day and shall be capable of acceptance by the relevant Purchaser on or before
such time by communicating its acceptance in writing to the Purchase Agent or,
if it is the Purchase Agent, the relevant Lenders. The Purchase Agent (if
someone other than the Purchaser) will communicate to the relevant Lenders
which offers have been accepted by 12 noon on the third Business Day
following such Solicitation day. In any event by 11 a.m. on the fourth Business
Day following such Solicitation day, the Purchaser shall notify the Agent of the
amounts of the participations purchased through the relevant Solicitation
Process and the identity of the Facilities to which they relate. The Agent shall
disclose such information to any Lender that requests such disclosure.

(b) If it chooses to accept any offers made pursuant to a Solicitation Process the
Purchaser shall be free to select which offers and in which amounts it accepts
but on the basis that in relation to a participation in a particular Facility it accepts
offers in inverse order of the price offered (with the offer or offers at the lowest
price being accepted first) and that if in respect of participations in a particular
Facility it receives two or more offers at the same price it shall only accept such
offers on a pro rata basis.

(c) Any purchase of participations in the Facilities pursuant to a Solicitation
Process shall be completed and settled on or before the fifth Business Day after
the relevant Solicitation day.

(d) In accepting any offers made pursuant to a Solicitation Process the Company
shall be free to select which offers and in which amounts it accepts.

28.5 A Debt Purchase Transaction referred to in Clause 28.3 above may also be entered into
pursuant to an open order process (an “Open Order Process”) which is carried out as
follows:

(a) the Company (on behalf of the relevant Borrower(s)) may by itself or through
another Purchase Agent place an open order (an “Open Order”) to purchase
participations in one or more of the Facilities up to a set aggregate amount at a
set price by notifying at the same time all the Lenders participating in the
relevant Facilities of the same. Any Lender wishing to sell pursuant to an Open
Order will, by 11:00 a.m. on any Business Day following the date on which the
Open Order is placed but no earlier than the first Business Day, and no later
than the fifth Business Day, following the date on which the Open Order is
placed, communicate to the Purchase Agent details of the amount of its
participations, and in which Facilities, it is offering to sell. Any such offer to
sell shall be irrevocable until 11:00 a.m. on the Business Day following the date
of such offer from the Lender and shall be capable of acceptance by the
Company on behalf of the relevant Borrower(s) on or before such time by it
communicating such acceptance in writing to the relevant Lender;


-----

(b) any purchase of participations in the Facilities pursuant to an Open Order
Process shall be completed and settled by the relevant Borrower(s) on or before
the fourth Business Day after the date of the relevant offer by a Lender to sell
under the relevant Open Order;

(c) if in respect of participations in a Facility the Purchase Agent receives on the
same Business Day two or more offers at the set price such that the maximum
amount of such Facility to which an Open Order relates would be exceeded, the
Company shall only accept such offers on a pro rata basis; and

(d) the Company shall, by 5:00 p.m. on the sixth Business Day following the date
on which an Open Order is placed, notify the Agent of the amounts of the
participations purchased through such Open Order Process and the identity of
the Facilities to which they relate. The Agent shall promptly disclose such
information to the Lenders.

28.6 For the avoidance of doubt, there is no limit on the number of occasions a Solicitation
Process or Open Order Process may be implemented.

28.7 In relation to any Debt Purchase Transaction entered into pursuant to this Clause 28,
notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement or the other Finance Documents (in
the case of a Lender which is a Sponsor Affiliate or a member of the Group, for so long
as it remains a Sponsor Affiliate or a member of the Group):

(a) on completion of the relevant assignment pursuant to Clause 27 (Changes to the
_Lenders), the portions of the Loans to which it relates shall, unless there would_
be a materially adverse tax cost or impact on the Group as a result of such
cancellation, be extinguished if the purchaser is the relevant Borrower and any
related repayment instalments will be reduced pro rata;

(b) such Debt Purchase Transaction and the related extinguishment referred to in
paragraph (a) above shall not constitute a prepayment of the Facilities;

(c) for the purpose of testing compliance with the financial covenant in Clause 24
(Financial Covenants), any impact of any Debt Purchase Transaction on
Consolidated EBIT or Consolidated EBITDA shall be ignored;

(d) the Company, the Obligor or Purchaser which is the assignee shall be deemed
to be an entity which fulfils the requirements of Clause 27.2 (Assignments and
_Transfers by Lenders) to be a New Lender (as defined in such Clause);_

(e) no member of the Group shall be deemed to be in breach of any provision of
Clause 25.19 (Financial Indebtedness), Clause 25.16 (Loans or credit) and
Clause 25.10 (Holding Companies), Clause 25.8 (Acquisitions) or any other
provision of any Finance Document solely by reason of such Debt Purchase
Transaction;

(f) Clause 32 (Sharing among the Finance Parties) shall not be applicable to the
consideration paid under such Debt Purchase Transaction;


-----

(g) for the avoidance of doubt, any extinguishment of any part of the Loans shall
not affect any amendment or waiver which prior to such extinguishment had
been approved by or on behalf of the requisite Lender or Lenders in accordance
with this Agreement;

(h) unless all amounts owing to the other Lenders under this Agreement will be paid
in full at the same time as such prepayment, neither the Company or an Obligor
or Purchaser will be entitled to receive any prepayment pursuant to this
Agreement and the amount of any such prepayment which would have been so
received by it shall be applied pro rata to prepay all other Lenders in the relevant
Facility; and

(i) neither the Company nor any Obligor which completes a Debt Purchase
Transaction or Purchaser shall be entitled to exercise any rights or be entitled to
any payment pursuant to Clause 16 (Taxes) or Clause 16.3 (Tax indemnity).

28.8 Each Obligor or other Purchaser that becomes a Lender pursuant to this Clause 28
agrees that for so long as it remains a Sponsor Affiliate or a member of the Group:

(a) in relation to any meeting or conference call to which all the Lenders are invited
to attend or participate, unless the Agent otherwise agrees, it shall not attend or
participate in the same or be entitled to receive the agenda or any minutes of the
same;

(b) in its capacity as Lender, unless the Agent otherwise agrees, it shall not be
entitled to receive any report or other document prepared at the behest of, or on
the instructions of, the Agent or one or more of the Lenders; and

(c) other than where the relevant vote affects the rights and/or interests of the
Sponsor Affiliate or member of the Group (or their Affiliates) in its capacity as
a Lender in a manner that is disproportionate to any Lender of the same class,
in ascertaining the Lenders, the Majority Lenders, the Majority RCF Lenders,
the Majority Super Senior Lenders or the Super Majority Lenders or whether
any given percentage of the Total Commitments has been obtained to give an

defined therein) and such Subsidiary shall become a Party as a Guarantor and a
party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor (as defined therein).

Group or that Obligor is the subject of a Permitted Disposal or a
Permitted Reorganisation pursuant to which it is to be liquidated, wound
up or dissolved (or pursuant to which it will otherwise cease to exist); or

or will become Additional Guarantors on or prior to the date on which
the resignation will become effect) would have been complied with
excluding that applicable Obligor; or

(iii) the Super Majority Lenders and the Majority Super Senior Lenders have

continuing or would result from the acceptance of the Resignation Letter;

outstanding under this Agreement (or will be outstanding at the time of
resignation), and in the case of a Guarantor no payment is due and
payable from that Guarantor under Clause 21 (Guarantees and
_Indemnity);_

(iii) in the case of a Borrower which is also a Guarantor (unless it is
simultaneously resigning as a Guarantor in accordance with this Clause

valid, binding and enforceable and in full force and effect (subject to the
Legal Reservations); and

Proceeds will be applied in accordance with Clause 10.2 (Disposal,
_Insurance and Recovery Proceeds) (in each case if and to the extent_
required by that Clause).

resignation of a Borrower or a Guarantor, that entity shall cease to be a Borrower
or a Guarantor (as applicable) and shall have no further rights or obligations
under the Finance Documents as a Borrower or a Guarantor (as applicable). For
the avoidance of doubt, if an Obligor ceases to be a member of the Group


-----

pursuant to a transaction not prohibited by this Agreement, that Obligor shall
automatically cease to be an Obligor for all purposes and shall have no further
rights or obligations under the Finance Documents as an Obligor, except that,
where the Borrower or Guarantor is the subject of a Third Party Disposal, the
resignation shall not take effect (and the Borrower or Guarantor will continue
to have rights and obligations under the Finance Documents) until the date on
which the Third Party Disposal takes effect.

the Repeating Representations are true and correct in relation to it as at the date of
delivery as if made by reference to the facts and circumstances then existing.

resigns as a Guarantor in accordance with Clause 29.4 (Resignation of an
_Obligor) above:_

(i) in a manner not prohibited by the terms of this Agreement (including
pursuant to a Permitted Disposal, Permitted Reorganisation, a Permitted
Structural Adjustment, the implementation of other actions permitted
under the Finance Documents or any release contemplated under Clause
39.3 (Transaction Security and Guarantees) whether or not requiring a
consent thereunder); or

Holding Company of an Obligor to a person who is not a member of the Group,
over the respective assets of such Obligor and its Subsidiaries (and the shares in
any such Obligor and/or Subsidiary), issue any certificate of non-crystallisation
of any floating charge and carry out any other action (including notification and
filings for cancelling any registration) that may reasonably be required or
considered necessary or desirable in connection with that disposal and that
release **provided that in the case of any Permitted Reorganisation, the**
requirements of the definition of “Permitted Reorganisation” are complied with.

(b) In relation to any Transaction Security over a bank account of an Obligor, the
Security Agent is hereby authorised by the Secured Parties to release any
Security granted in favour of the Security Agent and held over any bank account
of an Obligor that is subject to Transaction Security provided that prior to such
release the relevant Obligor has transferred the balance standing to that account
to another bank account held by it (a “Recipient Account”) and the Security

Agent is satisfied (acting reasonably) that the relevant Obligor has granted valid
and effective Transaction Security over such Recipient Account consistent with
the Agreed Security Principles or there is no credit balance on account first
referred to.

(c) The Security Agent is permitted, is authorised and (if requested by the Company)
shall enter into amendment agreements in relation to the relevant Transaction

so in order to persuade the proposed successor Agent to become a party to this
Agreement as Agent) agree with the proposed successor Agent amendments to
this Clause 30 and any other term of this Agreement dealing with the rights or
obligations of the Agent consistent with then current market practice for the
appointment and protection of corporate trustees together with any reasonable
amendments to the agency fee payable under this Agreement which are

Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on
or after that FATCA Application Date; or

be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that
FATCA Application Date;

and (in each case) the Company or a Lender reasonably believes that a Party
will be required to make a FATCA Deduction that would not be required if the

to the Agent, requires it to resign.

30.12 **Replacement of the Agent**

(a) After consultation with the Company, the Majority Lenders may by giving 30

reasonably request for the purposes of performing its functions as Agent under
the Finance Documents.

(d) The appointment of the successor Agent shall take effect on the date specified
in the notice from the Majority Lenders (or as applicable the Company) to the
retiring Agent. As from this date, the retiring Agent shall be discharged from

entitled to the benefit of this Clause 30 (and any agency fees for the account of

be treated as confidential to that division or department and the Agent shall not
be deemed to have notice of it.

law or a breach of a fiduciary duty.

case, the department or officer, if any, for whose attention communication is to
be made) and be treated as a notification of a substitute address, fax number,
electronic mail address, department and officer by that Lender for the purposes
of Clause 35.2 (Addresses) and Clause 35.6 (Electronic communication) and the

**Amount”) and applies that amount to a payment due under the Finance**
Documents then:

(i) the Recovering Finance Party shall, within three Business Days, notify
details of the receipt or recovery, to the Agent;

(ii) the Agent shall determine whether the receipt or recovery is in excess of
the amount the Recovering Finance Party would have been paid had the
receipt or recovery been received or made by the Agent and distributed
in accordance with Clause 33 (Payment Mechanics), without taking
account of any Tax which would be imposed on the Agent in relation to
the receipt, recovery or distribution; and


-----

(iii) the Recovering Finance Party shall, within three Business Days of
demand by the Agent, pay to the Agent an amount (the “Sharing
**Payment”) equal to such receipt or recovery less any amount which the**
Agent determines may be retained by the Recovering Finance Party as
its share of any payment to be made, in accordance with Clause 33.6
(Partial payments).

(b) Paragraph (a) above shall not apply to any amount received or recovered by an
Ancillary Lender in respect of any cash cover provided for the benefit of that
Ancillary Lender.

32.2 **Redistribution of payments**

Sharing Finance Parties.

32.3 **Recovering Finance Party’s rights**

On a distribution by the Agent under Clause 32.2 (Redistribution of payments) of a
payment received by a Recovering Finance Party from the Parent or an Obligor, as

amount of the Recovered Amount equal to the Sharing Payment will be treated as not
having been paid by the Parent or that Obligor.

32.4 **Reversal of redistribution**

If any part of the Sharing Payment received or recovered by a Recovering Finance Party
becomes repayable and is repaid by that Recovering Finance Party, then:

(a) each Sharing Finance Party shall, upon request of the Agent, pay to the Agent
for the account of that Recovering Finance Party an amount equal to the
appropriate part of its share of the Sharing Payment (together with an amount
as is necessary to reimburse that Recovering Finance Party for its proportion of
any interest on the Sharing Payment which that Recovering Finance Party is
required to pay) (the “Redistributed Amount”); and

(b) as between the relevant Obligor or the Parent and each relevant Sharing Finance
Party, an amount equal to the relevant Redistributed Amount will be treated as
not having been paid by that Obligor.

32.5 **Exceptions**

(a) This Clause 32 shall not apply to the extent that the Recovering Finance Party
would not, after making any payment pursuant to this Clause, have a valid and
enforceable claim against the relevant Obligor or the Parent.

33. **PAYMENT MECHANICS**

33.1 **Payments to the Agent**

(a) On each date on which the Parent or an Obligor or a Lender is required to make
a payment under a Finance Document excluding a payment under the terms of
an Ancillary Document, the Parent or that Obligor or Lender shall make the
same available to the Agent (unless a contrary indication appears in a Finance
Document) for value on the due date at the time and in such funds specified by
the Agent as being customary at the time for settlement of transactions in the
relevant currency in the place of payment.

(b) Payment shall be made to such account in the principal financial centre of the
country of that currency (or, in relation to Euro, in a principal financial centre

the Party entitled to receive payment in accordance with this Agreement (in the case of
a Lender, for the account of its Facility Office), to such account as that Party may notify
to the Agent by not less than five Business Days’ notice with a bank in the principal
financial centre of the country of that currency (or, in relation to Euro, in the principal
financial centre of a Participating Member State).


-----

33.3 **Distributions to the Parent or an Obligor**

The Agent may (with the consent of the Parent or the Obligor or in accordance with
Clause 36 (Calculations and Certificates)) apply any amount received by it for the
Parent or that Obligor in or towards payment (on the date and in the currency and funds
of receipt) of any amount due from the Parent or that Obligor under the Finance
Documents or in or towards purchase of any amount of any currency to be so applied.

33.4 **Clawback**

(a) Where a sum is to be paid to the Agent under the Finance Documents for another
Party, the Agent is not obliged to pay that sum to that other Party (or to enter
into or perform any related exchange contract) until it has been able to establish
to its satisfaction that it has actually received that sum.

(b) If the Agent pays an amount to another Party and it proves to be the case that
the Agent had not actually received that amount, then the Party to whom that
amount (or the proceeds of any related exchange contract) was paid by the
Agent shall on demand refund the same to the Agent together with interest on
that amount from the date of payment to the date of receipt by the Agent,
calculated by the Agent to reflect its cost of funds.

33.5 **Impaired Agent**

(a) If, at any time, the Agent becomes an Impaired Agent, the Parent, an Obligor or

the Agent in accordance with Clause 33.1 (Payments to the Agent) may instead
either pay that amount direct to the required recipient or pay that amount to an
interest bearing account held with an Acceptable Bank within the meaning of
paragraph (a) of the definition of “Acceptable Bank” and in relation to which
no Insolvency Event has occurred and is continuing, in the name of the Obligor
or the Lender making the payment and designated as a trust account for the
benefit of the Party or Parties beneficially entitled to that payment under the
Finance Documents. In each case such payments must be made on the due date
for payment under the Finance Documents.

(b) All interest accrued on the amount standing to the credit of the trust account
shall be for the benefit of the beneficiaries of that trust account pro rata to their
respective entitlements.

discharged of the relevant payment obligation under the Finance Documents
and shall not take any credit risk with respect to the amounts standing to the
credit of the trust account.

(d) Promptly upon the appointment of a successor Agent in accordance with Clause
30.12 (Replacement of the Agent), each Party which has made a payment to a
trust account in accordance with this Clause 33.5 shall give all requisite
instructions to the bank with whom the trust account is held to transfer the
amount (together with any accrued interest) to the successor Agent for
distribution in accordance with Clause 33.2 (Distributions by the Agent).

(a) If the Agent receives a payment for application against amounts due in respect
of any Finance Documents that is insufficient to discharge all the amounts then

Obligor under those Finance Documents in the following order:

(i) _first, in or towards payment_ _pro rata of any unpaid fees, costs and_
expenses of the Agent and the Security Agent under those Finance
Documents;

Sum shall be made in the currency in which that Utilisation or Unpaid Sum is

respect of which the interest is payable was denominated when that interest
accrued.

(e) Any amount expressed to be payable in a currency other than the Base Currency

the official rate of exchange recognised by the central bank for the
conversion of that currency or currency unit into the other, rounded up
or down by the Agent (acting reasonably).

extent the Agent (acting reasonably and after consultation with the Company)
specifies to be necessary, be amended to comply with any generally accepted
conventions and market practice in the Relevant Market and otherwise to reflect
the change in currency.

the extent beneficially owned by that Finance Party) against any matured
obligation owed by that Finance Party to the Parent or that Obligor, regardless
of the place of payment, booking branch or currency of either obligation. If the

Finance Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the
Consenting Lenders and the Obligors’ Agent, to give effect to the provisions of
this paragraph (d) including any amendments necessary to treat the applicable
Loans and/or Commitments of the Consenting Lenders as a new “class” of loans
and/or commitments hereunder.

(e) No consent from any Lender shall be required in connection with the
implementation of an Additional Facility pursuant to Clause 2.2 (Additional
_Facility) and any Additional Facility Notice (other than the consent of the_
relevant Additional Facility Lender(s) or person(s) providing the Additional
Facility).

(f) Any amendment or waiver which relates adversely to the specific rights or
obligations of the Agent, the Backstop Lender, any Ancillary Lender, a Hedge
Counterparty, any Reference Bank or the Security Agent (in each case in such
capacity) respectively may not be effected without the consent of the Agent, the
Backstop Lender, the relevant Ancillary Lender, the relevant Hedge
Counterparty, the relevant Reference Bank or the Security Agent (as the case
may be). For the avoidance of doubt, this Clause 39.2 shall not entitle any Party
to refuse its consent to any release of a guarantee or Transaction Security which
would otherwise be permitted under Clause 39.3 (Transaction Security and
_Guarantees) or another provision of the Finance Documents._

(g) Any amendment or waiver which relates to the rights or obligations applicable
to a particular Utilisation, Facility or class of Lenders and which does not
materially and adversely affect the rights or interests of Lenders in respect of
other Utilisations, Facilities or another class of Lender shall only require the
consent of the Majority Lenders, Super Majority Lenders or all Lenders (as
applicable) as if references in this paragraph (g) to “Majority Lenders”,
“Super Majority Lenders” or “Lenders” were only to Lenders participating
in that Utilisation, Facility or forming part of that affected class. For the
avoidance of doubt, this paragraph (g) is without prejudice to the ability to effect,


-----

make or grant any amendment, waiver, consent or release pursuant to or in
accordance with paragraph (f) above.

(h) The right of a Lender to be prepaid following a Change of Control or a Sale or
a Listing pursuant to paragraph (a) of Clause 10.1 (Exit and Listing) may only
be amended or waived with the consent of that Lender. Any amendment to
Clause 10.2 (Disposal, Insurance and Recovery Proceeds) (including a waiver
of a right of prepayment) may be approved with the consent of the Majority
Lenders.

(i) Any amendment or waiver to the definition of “Majority Lenders” participating
in a particular Facility shall only require the consent of the Lenders participating
in that particular Facility.

(j) An amendment or a waiver or consent of, or in relation to, any term of any
Finance Document that has the effect of waiving or changing:

(i) any conditions to Utilisation in respect of the Revolving Facility;

(ii) the Revolving Facility Lenders’ right to accelerate the Revolving
Facility pursuant to paragraph (b) of Clause 26.17 (Acceleration); and/or

(iii) (subject to paragraph (k) below) any RCF Consent Provision,

shall be made or given with the prior consent of the Majority RCF Lenders.

(k) An amendment, waiver or consent of, or in relation to, any term of any Finance
Document that has the effect of waiving:

(i) [Reserved];

(ii) a RCF Consent Provision or any conditions to Utilisation in respect of
the Revolving Facility shall only be made or given with the prior consent
of the Majority RCF Lenders; and/or

(iii) a Super Senior Consent Provision shall only require the prior consent of
the Majority Super Senior Lenders, save that the items referred to in
paragraphs (e), (h), (k), (n), (p), (q) and, to the extent materially adverse
to the interests of all of the Lenders, (t) shall only be made or given with
the prior consent of the Majority Super Senior Lenders and the Majority
Lenders.

(l) Any amendment or waiver which relates only to the provisions governing
transfers by Lenders and which makes such provisions more restrictive for any
of the Lenders shall only require the consent of each Lender who will be subject
to the resulting additional restrictions.

(m) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Finance Documents, a Finance
Party may unilaterally waive, relinquish or otherwise irrevocably give up all or
any of its rights under any Finance Document (including any mandatory
prepayment right) with the consent of the Obligors’ Agent.


-----

(n) Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, no amendment or
waiver of a term of a Hedging Agreement shall require the consent of any
Finance Party other than the relevant Hedge Counterparty.

(o) Subject to compliance with Clause 7.3 (Terms of Ancillary Facilities), no
amendment or waiver of a term of any Ancillary Document shall require the
consent of any Finance Party other than the relevant Ancillary Lender unless
such amendment or waiver would require an amendment or waiver of this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt Clause 7 (Ancillary
_Facilities)), and in such case the other provisions of this Clause shall apply._

(p) If the Obligors’ Agent or the Agent (at the request of the Obligors’ Agent) has
requested the Finance Parties (or any of them) to give a consent in relation to,
or to agree a release, waiver or amendment of, any provision of the Finance
Documents or other vote of Lenders under the terms of this Agreement, then in
the case of:

(i) any Finance Party who has delivered a consent or agreement to such
request, on and from the date of notification thereof to the Agent;

(ii) any Excluded Lender, on and from the Exclusion Date (each as defined
in Clause 39.5 (Excluded Commitments)); and

(iii) any other Non-Consenting Lender (as defined in Clause 39.4
(Replacement of Finance Party)) and its applicable participation,
(without prejudice to paragraph (ii) above), on and from the date such
Lender is replaced in accordance with the provisions of Clause 39.4
(Replacement of Finance Party) (on which date a consent or agreement
to such request shall be treated and deemed as having been made by such
Non-Consenting Lender and received by the Agent),

(unless otherwise agreed by the Obligors’ Agent), such consent or agreement
shall from such time (and to the extent subsequently approved by the requisite
group of Lenders in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) be
irrevocable and binding on such Finance Party, Excluded Lender and NonConsenting Lender (as applicable) and any permitted assignee, transferee or
counterparty to a sub-participation.

(q) Any Finance Party (not being an Excluded Lender) or its permitted assignee or
transferee that has expressly not consented or not agreed to a request for an
amendment, waiver, consent or release shall always have the right to change or
revoke their decision and subsequently deliver to the Agent a consent or
agreement to such request at any time during the period for which the vote and
request process is open for consents and acceptances as notified by the Agent to
such Lender (and subject to any extension of such period as agreed between the
Obligors’ Agent and the Agent).

(r) No amendment or waiver of a term of any Fee Letter or other side letter shall
require the consent of any Finance Party other than any such person which is
party to such letter.


-----

(s) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any amendment, waiver, consent or
release of a Finance Document made in accordance with Clause 2.2 (Additional
_Facility), Clause 2.3 (Increase), Clause 29.6 (Release of Security), Clause 39.3_
(Transaction Security and Guarantees), Clause 39.4 (Replacement of Finance
_Party) and Clause 39.7 (Additional Facilities, Permitted Structural Adjustment_
_and Replacement Facilities Documentation) shall be binding on all Parties_
without further consent of any Party.

(t) Any term of the Finance Documents (other than any Hedging Agreement or any
Ancillary Document) may be amended or waived by the Obligors’ Agent and
the Agent (or, if applicable, the Security Agent) without the consent of any other
Party if that amendment or waiver is to cure defects or omissions; resolve
ambiguities or inconsistencies; reflect changes of a minor, technical or
administrative nature or manifest error; is otherwise only for the benefit of all
or any of the Lenders; or (provided that such waiver or amendment does not
adversely affect the interests of the other Lenders whose consent is not required
for the applicable amendment) is consequential on, incidental to, or required to
implement an amendment, waiver, consent or release set about above.

(u) Any amendment, waiver, consent or release made or effected in accordance with
any of paragraphs (a) to (t) above, or in accordance with any other term of any
of the Finance Documents, shall be binding on all Parties. Each Secured Party
irrevocably and unconditionally authorises and instructs the Agent (for the
benefit of the Agent and the Company) to execute any documentation relating
to a proposed amendment or waiver as soon as the requisite Lender consent is
received (or on such later date as may be agreed by the Agent and Company).
Without prejudice to the foregoing, the Finance Parties shall enter into any
documentation necessary to implement an amendment or waiver once that
amendment or waiver has been approved by the requisite number of Lenders
determined in accordance with this Clause 39.

(v) Any Declared Default, a Default or an Event of Default applicable to all Lenders
may be revoked or, as the case may be, waived with the consent of the Majority
Lenders or, if applicable and in relation to a Material Event of Default, the
Majority Super Senior Lenders. Any notice, demand, declaration or other step
or action taken under or pursuant to Clause 26.17 (Acceleration) may be
revoked with the consent of the Majority Lenders, or if applicable, the Majority
RCF Lenders.

(w) In the event that the Company and the Original Lenders determine that any Term
Facilities should rank pari passu with the Original Revolving Facility, each such
party agrees to act reasonably and in good faith to negotiate any amendments,
replacements, supplements, restatements or waivers to the Finance Documents
as are necessary or desirable to facilitate such inclusion and the Lenders
irrevocably authorise the Agent to enter into any such documents in their behalf.

39.3 **Transaction Security and Guarantees**

(a) An amendment or waiver that:

(i) has the effect of changing or which relates to:

(A) (other than as expressly permitted by the provisions of any
Finance Document) the nature or scope of any guarantee or
indemnity granted pursuant to Clause 21 (Guarantees and
_Indemnity) or the Charged Property; or_

(B) the release of all or substantially all of the Transaction Security
or the guarantees or indemnities granted under this Agreement,

shall require the consent of the Super Majority Lenders and the Majority
Super Senior Lenders; and

(ii) has the effect of changing or which relates to the manner in which the
proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security are distributed shall
not be made without the prior consent of all Lenders,

in each case unless: (1) that release is to become effective on or following the
prepayment and cancellation in full of the Facilities; (2) that release is otherwise
contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement or this Agreement (including
Clause 2.2 (Additional Facility), Clause 2.3 (Increase), Clause 29.4
(Resignation of an Obligor), Clause 29.6 (Release of Security), Clause 39.2
(Exceptions), this Clause 39.3, Clause 39.4 (Replacement of Finance Party) and
Clause 39.7 (Additional Facilities, Permitted Structural Adjustment and
_Replacement Facilities Documentation)) and/or made or permitted in_
accordance with another provision of the Finance Documents; (3) the relevant
Obligors and/or assets are directly or indirectly the subject of a Disposal which
is not prohibited by the terms of this Agreement or the intercreditor Agreement;
or (4) that release or amendment is required to implement or facilitate any
Additional Facility, Permitted Structural Adjustment or intercreditor position,
in which case approval for any item referred to in paragraph (a)(i) or (a)(ii)
above will be automatic and the Security Agent shall be authorised to release
such guarantees or Transaction Security (provided that, where applicable, any
such release shall be without prejudice to any obligation to provide replacement
security).

Any amendment, change or waiver of this paragraph (a) shall also require the
prior consent of the Super Majority Lenders and the Majority Super Senior
Lenders (or with respect to paragraph (a)(ii), the prior consent of all the
Lenders).

(b) Notwithstanding any other term, condition or restriction in any other Finance
Document, the Parties agree that, in connection with any Permitted Structural
Adjustment or any Additional Facility, and implementation of any intercreditor
position, each Obligor is and the Security Agent is irrevocably authorised to
enter into any new Transaction Security Document and/or amend or waive any


-----

terms of an existing Transaction Security Document and/or release any asset
from Transaction Security subject to the following conditions:

(i) any new Transaction Security which secures the Facilities (or following
a Permitted Structural Adjustment, such new Transaction Security) shall
be:

(A) subject to the Agreed Security Principles and applicable law,
granted in favour of the Security Agent for and on behalf of the
relevant Lenders (as applicable) and the then existing Secured
Parties;

(B) (if applicable) on terms substantially the same (except that it
shall also secure the Additional Facilities, and any other
Facilities arising as a result of or in connection with a Permitted
Structural Adjustment) as the terms of the existing Transaction
Security over equivalent asset(s); and

(C) for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, treated as
securing amounts not in priority to the then existing Transaction
Security; and

(ii) any amendment or waiver of a Transaction Security Document or
release or release and re-grant of Transaction Security shall only be
undertaken:

(A) if required under the terms of the Additional Facilities and any
other Facilities arising as a result of or in connection with a
Permitted Structural Adjustment or to the extent necessary under
applicable law to ensure that any Additional Facilities and any
other Facilities arising as a result of or in connection with a
Permitted Structural Adjustment ranks in right of payment and
security with the Facilities in accordance with the intercreditor
position or other position set out in the Additional Facility Notice;
and

(B) if any asset is to be released from Transaction Security, promptly
upon giving effect to that release, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles and applicable law, replacement Transaction Security
is granted in favour of the Security Agent for and on behalf of
the relevant Lenders and the existing Secured Parties on
substantially the same terms of the Transaction Security released
(except that it shall also secure the Additional Facilities and any
other Facilities arising as a result of or in connection with a
Permitted Structural Adjustment) provided that, in each case, a
release coupled with the retaking of Transaction Security shall
only be effected where it is not otherwise possible for that
Additional Facility to so share the benefit of the Transaction
Security and there is no reasonable alternative structure having
regard to the Agreed Security Principles and, further, having
commercially substantially the same effect (such as, for example,


-----

the existing Transaction Security not being released and re-taken
but instead subsequent ranking Transaction Security being
granted in respect of that Additional Facility and the Additional
Facility Lenders and the person(s) providing such Additional
Facility relying on the contractual ranking agreed in respect of
that Additional Facility, and the Transaction Security in the
Intercreditor Agreement and related provisions, such as the
Additional Facility Lenders’ rights to share Recoveries (as that
term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) pro rata and pari
_passu with the other Lenders, to the extent that such Additional_
Facility is intended to be _pari passu, or junior to the other_
Lenders, to the extent that such Additional Facility is intended to
be junior, subject to the relevant amendments being made to the
Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to clause 2.4 (Additional
_and/or Refinancing Debt) and clause 18.3 (Facilitation) of the_
Intercreditor Agreement).

(c) The Transaction Security Documents may be amended, varied, waived or
modified with the agreement of the relevant Obligor and/or, as applicable, the
Parent and the Security Agent acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement.

39.4 **Replacement of Finance Party**

(a) If at any time:

(i) any Finance Party becomes or is a Non-Consenting Lender (as defined
in paragraph (d) below);

(ii) an Obligor becomes obliged to repay any amount in accordance with
Clause 9.1 (Illegality) following the delivery of an Illegality Notice;

(iii) any sum payable to any Lender by the Parent or an Obligor is or will be
required to be increased under paragraph (c) of Clause 16.2 (Tax gross_up) or any Lender claims or will be entitled to claim indemnification_
from the Parent or an Obligor under Clause 16.3 (Tax indemnity) or
Clause 17.1 (Increased costs);

(iv) any Finance Party invokes the benefit of Clause 14.2 (Market
_disruption); or_

(v) any Finance Party becomes or is a Defaulting Lender,

then the Obligors’ Agent may, on not less than five Business Days’ prior written
notice (a “Replacement Notice”) to the Agent and such Finance Party (a
“Replaced Finance Party”):

(A) replace a participation of such Replaced Finance Party by
requiring such Replaced Finance Party to (and such Replaced
Finance Party shall) transfer pursuant to Clause 27 (Changes to
_the Lenders) on such dates as specified in the Replacement_


-----

Notice all or part of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement to a Lender constituting a New Lender under Clause
27.2 (Assignments and Transfers by Lenders) (a “Replacement
**Lender”) selected by the Obligors’ Agent, which confirms its**
(or their) willingness to assume and does assume all or part of
the obligations of the Replaced Finance Party (including the
assumption of the Replaced Finance Party’s participations or
unfunded or undrawn participations (as the case may be) on the
same basis as the Replaced Finance Party) for a purchase price
in cash payable at the time of transfer:

(1) in an amount which is equal to the applicable outstanding
principal amount of such Replaced Finance Party’s
participation in the outstanding Utilisations or Ancillary
Outstandings and all related accrued interest and/or
Break Costs in respect of such transferred participation;
or

(2) such other amount agreed between the Replaced Finance
Party, the Replacement Lender and the Obligors’ Agent
and which does not exceed the amount described in
paragraph (1) above; and/or

(B) prepay (or procure that another member of the Group prepays)
on such dates as specified in the Replacement Notice, provided
**that, where a prepayment is made to a Non-Consenting Lender,**
such prepayment is funded directly or indirectly from any
Acceptable Funding Sources (or such other source as approved
by the Majority Lenders), all or any part of such Lender’s
participation in the outstanding Utilisations or Ancillary
Outstandings and all related accrued interest and/or Break Costs
and costs and expenses then due and payable under the Finance
Documents to that Replaced Finance Party in respect of such
participation; and/or

(C) cancel all or part of the undrawn Commitments or Ancillary
Commitments of that Replaced Finance Party on such dates as
specified in the Replacement Notice.

(b) Any notice delivered under paragraph (a) above (or any subsequent notice for
this purpose, as applicable) may be accompanied by a Transfer Certificate
complying with Clause 27.7 (Procedure for transfer) and/or an Assignment
Agreement complying with Clause 27.8 (Procedure for assignment) and any
other related documentation to effect the transfer or assignment, which Transfer
Certificate, Assignment Agreement and any other related documentation to
effect the transfer or assignment (if attached) shall be promptly (and by no later
than five Business Days from receiving such Transfer Certificate, Assignment
Agreement and any other related documentation) executed by the relevant
Replaced Finance Party and returned to the Obligors’ Agent. Notwithstanding
the requirements of Clause 27 (Changes to the Lenders) or any other provisions


-----

of the Finance Documents, if a Replaced Finance Party does not execute and/or
return a Transfer Certificate, an Assignment Agreement and any other related
documentation to effect the transfer or assignment as required by this paragraph
(b) within three Business Days of delivery by the Obligors’ Agent, the relevant
transfer or transfers or assignment or assignments shall automatically and
immediately be effected for all purposes under the Finance Documents on
payment of the replacement amount to the Agent (for the account of the relevant
Replaced Finance Party), and the Agent may (and is authorised by each Finance
Party to) execute, without requiring any further consent or action from any other
party, a Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement and any other related
documentation to effect the transfer or assignment on behalf of the relevant
Replaced Finance Party which is required to transfer its rights and obligations
or assign its rights under this Agreement pursuant to paragraph (a) above which
shall be effective for the purposes of Clause 27.7 (Procedure for transfer) and
Clause 27.8 (Procedure for assignment). The Agent shall not be liable in any
way for any action taken by it pursuant to this paragraph (b) and, for the
avoidance of doubt, the provisions of Clause 30.9 (Exclusion of liability) shall
apply in relation thereto.

(c) Unless otherwise agreed by the Majority Lenders or provided pursuant to
another provision of this Agreement, the replacement of a Lender pursuant to
this Clause 39.4 shall be subject to the following conditions:

(i) the Company must ensure that all (and not part only) of a Lenders’ rights
and obligations under this Agreement are replaced, prepaid or cancelled
in full in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (A) to (C) above
notwithstanding that the Company may exercise any of its rights under
such provisions in whole or in part;

(ii) the Obligors’ Agent shall have no right to replace the Agent or Security
Agent in its capacity as such;

(iii) the Obligors’ Agent may only exercise its replacement or prepayment
rights (pursuant to sub-paragraph (a)(i) above in respect of any NonConsenting Lender), at any time prior to the date falling 90 days after
the Non-Consenting Lender notifies the Company and the Agent of its
refusal to give a consent to any requested release, waiver or amendment;
or (in the case of sub-paragraph (a)(ii) above) within 90 days of
becoming aware of such circumstance; or (in the case of sub-paragraph
(a)(iv) above) within 90 days of the delivery of the Replacement Notice;

(iv) neither the Agent nor the Lender shall have any obligation to the
Company to find a Replacement Lender; and

(v) in no event shall the Lender replaced under this Clause 39.4 be required
to pay or surrender to such Replacement Lender any of the fees received
by such Lender pursuant to the Finance Documents.

(d) If the Obligors’ Agent or the Agent (at the request of the Obligors’ Agent) has
requested the Lenders to give a consent in relation to, or to agree to a release,
waiver or amendment of, any provisions of the Finance Documents or other vote


-----

of the Lenders under the terms of this Agreement, where the requested consent,
release, waiver or amendment is one which requires greater than Majority
Lender consent (including for the avoidance of doubt, in relation to any
Structural Adjustment) pursuant to this Agreement and has been agreed to by
the Majority Lenders (or the Majority Lenders under the relevant Facility as the
case may be), then any Lender who has not consented or agreed (or fails to reject)
to such request by the end of the period of 10 Business Days (or any other period
of time notified by the Company, with the prior agreement of the Agent if the
period for this provision to operate is less than 10 Business Days) of a request
being made shall be deemed a “Non-Consenting Lender”.

39.5 **Excluded Commitments**

If:

(a) a Lender does not accept or reject a request from a member of the Group (or the
Agent on behalf of that member of the Group) for any consent or agreement in
relation to a release, waiver or amendment of any provisions of the Finance
Documents or other vote of Lenders under the terms of the Finance Documents
within 10 Business Days, or if such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, five Business
Days (or any other period of time specified by that member of the Group but if
shorter than 10 Business Days, agreed by the Agent) of the date of such request
being made (the last day of such period, the “Exclusion Date”); or

(b) any Non-Consenting Lender fails to assist with any step required to implement
the Company’s right to prepay that Non-Consenting Lender or to replace that
Non-Consenting Lender pursuant to Clause 39.4 (Replacement of Finance Party)
within three Business Days of a request to do so by the Obligors’ Agent,

then, in each case:

(i) that Lender (an “Excluded Lender”) shall be automatically excluded
from participating in that vote, and its participations, Commitments and
vote (as the case may be) shall not be included (or, as applicable,
required) with the Total Commitments or otherwise when ascertaining
whether the approval of the Majority Lenders, the Super Majority
Lenders, all Lenders, or any other class of Lenders (as applicable) has
been obtained with respect to that request for a consent or agreement;
and

(ii) for the purposes of paragraph (b) above only, its status as a Lender shall
be disregarded for the purpose of ascertaining whether the agreement or
any specified group of Lenders has been obtained to approve the request.

39.6 **Disenfranchisement of Defaulting Lenders**

(a) In ascertaining the Majority Lenders, the Super Majority Lenders or any other
class of Lenders (as applicable) or whether any given percentage (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, unanimity) of any of the Total Commitments has been
obtained to approve any request for a consent, waiver, amendment or other vote


-----

under the Finance Documents, a Defaulting Lender’s Commitments and
participations will be deemed to be zero.

(b) For the purposes of this Clause 39.6, the Agent may assume that the following
Lenders are Defaulting Lenders:

(i) any Lender which has notified the Agent that it has become a Defaulting
Lender; and

(ii) any Lender in relation to which it is aware that any of the events or
circumstances referred to in the definition of “Defaulting Lender” has
occurred,

unless it has received notice to the contrary from the Lender concerned (together
with any supporting evidence reasonably requested by the Agent) or the Agent
is otherwise aware that the Lender has ceased to be a Defaulting Lender.

39.7 **Additional Facilities, Permitted Structural Adjustment and Replacement**
**Facilities Documentation**

(a) The Agent and/or the Security Agent, as the case may be, shall, on behalf of the
Secured Parties (unless a Secured Party is required under applicable law to do
so in its own name, in which case the relevant Secured Party shall) enter into
any confirmation, amendment, replacement of or supplement to the Finance
Documents (including without limitation, any amendment, waiver or release in
respect of any Transaction Security Document or any grant of Transaction
Security pursuant to a new Transaction Security Document) and/or take any
other action (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) as is necessary or
appropriate as determined by the Company and the Agent, each acting
reasonably, in order to facilitate the establishment of any Additional Facility or
Permitted Structural Adjustment, entered into in compliance with this
Agreement. The Agent and the Security Agent are irrevocably obligated,
authorised and instructed by each other Secured Party (without the requirement
for any further authorisation or consent from any other Secured Party) to enter
into such documentation and take any such action and shall do so promptly on
request and at the expense of the Obligors’ Agent.

(b) Each Obligor and the Parent confirms:

(i) the authority of the Obligors’ Agent to agree, implement and establish
any Additional Facility or Permitted Structural Adjustment in
accordance with this Agreement; and

(ii) that its guarantee and indemnity set out in Clause 21 (Guarantees and
_Indemnity) (or any applicable Accession Deed or other Finance_
Document), and all Transaction Security granted by it will (to the extent
provided pursuant to the terms of the relevant Additional Facility or
Permitted Structural Adjustment) entitle the Lenders under any
Additional Facility or Permitted Structural Adjustment to benefit from
such guarantee and indemnity and such Transaction Security (subject
only to any applicable limitations on such guarantee and indemnity set


-----

out in Clause 21 (Guarantees and Indemnity) or any Accession Deed
pursuant to which it became an Obligor) and extend to include all
obligations arising under or in respect of any Additional Facility or
Permitted Structural Adjustment (as applicable).

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Clause 39.7 shall oblige the
Security Agent, the Agent or any other Finance Party to execute any document
if it would impose personal liabilities or obligations on, or adversely affect the
rights, duties or immunities of the Security Agent, the Agent or such Finance
Party (provided that the incurrence of such Additional Facility and/or
Permitted Structural Adjustment (as applicable) shall not be deemed to
adversely affect the rights of any Finance Party) and nothing in this Clause 39.7
shall be construed as a commitment to advance or arrange any Additional
Facility or Permitted Structural Adjustment. The Agent and the Security Agent
are authorised and instructed by the Finance Parties to execute any document or
take any other action set out in this Clause 39.7 on behalf of the Finance Parties.

39.8 **Sanctions and Restricted Lenders**

(a) For the purpose of this Clause 39.8, a “Restricted Lender” means a Lender that
notifies the Agent that a Sanctions Provision would result in a violation of, a
conflict with or liability under Council Regulation (EC) 2271/1996 (or any
national legislation enacted pursuant to it), section 7 of the German Foreign
Trade Regulation (Außenwirtschaftsverordnung, AWV) (in conjunction with
section 4, paragraph 1, no. 3 and section 19, paragraph 3, no. 1(a) of the German
Foreign Trade Act (Außenwirtschaftsgesetz)) or any similar anti-boycott statute
applicable to that Lender.

(b) A Sanctions Provision shall only apply for the benefit of a Restricted Lender to
the extent that that Sanctions Provision would not result in any violation of,
conflict with or liability under Council Regulation (EC) 2271/1996 (or any
national legislation enacted pursuant to it), section 7 of the German Foreign
Trade Regulation (Außenwirtschaftsverordnung, AWV) (in conjunction with
section 4, paragraph 1, no. 3 and section 19, paragraph 3, no. 1(a) of the German
Foreign Trade Act (Außenwirtschaftsgesetz)) or any similar anti-boycott statute
applicable to that Lender.

(c) In connection with any amendment, waiver, determination or direction relating
to any part of a Sanctions Provision in relation to which:

(i) a Lender is a Restricted Lender; and

(ii) in accordance with paragraph (b) above, that Restricted Lender does not
have the benefit,

its Commitment shall not be included for the purpose of calculating the Total
Commitments under the Facility when ascertaining whether any relevant
percentage of Total Commitments has been obtained to approve such
amendment, waiver, determination or direction request and its status as a Lender
shall be disregarded for the purpose of ascertaining whether the agreement of


-----

any specified group of Lenders has been obtained to approve such amendment,
waiver, determination or direction.

39.9 **Replacement of Published Rate**

Subject to paragraph (f) of Clause 39.2 (Exceptions), if a Published Rate Replacement
Event has occurred in relation to any Published Rate for a currency which can be
selected for a Loan, any amendment or waiver which relates to:

(a) providing for the use of a Replacement Benchmark in relation to that currency
in place of (or in addition to) Published Rate; and

(b)

(i) aligning any provision of any Finance Document to the use of that
Replacement Benchmark;

(ii) enabling that Replacement Benchmark to be used for the calculation of
interest under this Agreement (including, without limitation, any
consequential changes required to enable that Replacement Benchmark
to be used for the purposes of this Agreement);

(iii) implementing market conventions applicable to that Replacement
Benchmark;

(iv) providing for appropriate fallback (and market disruption) provisions for
that Replacement Benchmark; or

(v) adjusting the pricing to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably
practicable, any transfer of economic value from one Party to another as
a result of the application of that Replacement Benchmark (and if any
adjustment or method for calculating any adjustment has been formally
designated, nominated or recommended by the Relevant Nominating
Body, the adjustment shall be determined on the basis of that
designation, nomination or recommendation),

may be made with the consent of the Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority
Lenders and if applicable, the Majority RCF Lenders) and the Company.

Obligors and the Parent) must promptly (and in any event within 10 Business

**SCHEDULE 10**
**AGREED SECURITY PRINCIPLES**

For the purposes of this Schedule 10, the term “Obligor” shall be deemed to include the Parent,
**provided that nothing herein shall require the Parent to grant any Security in addition to that**
which it has granted prior to the Closing Date unless specifically required by another clause or
section of this Agreement.

1. **Considerations**

(a) In determining what guarantees and Security will be provided in support of the
Facilities and all the rights and obligations associated with such giving or taking
of guarantees and Security the following matters will be taken into account.
Guarantees and Security (including pursuant to Clause 25.27 (Further
_assurance)) shall not be created or perfected to the extent that it would:_

(i) result in any breach of applicable general law and statutory limitations,
regulations applicable to the business of the Group or the Group in
general or in respect of a specific part of the business or specific
members of the Group (as the case may be), corporate benefit, capital
maintenance, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, retention of
title claims or thin capitalisation, “earnings stripping”, “controlled
foreign corporation” or “capital maintenance” laws or regulations (or
analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction;

(ii) result in a significant risk to the officers of the relevant grantor of the
guarantee and Security of contravention of their fiduciary duties or
contravene any legal prohibition and/or of civil or criminal liability; or

(iii) result in material incremental costs that are disproportionate to the
benefit obtained by the beneficiaries of that guarantee and Security.

(b) Parties shall take into account any existing bona fide third party arrangements
which are not prohibited by this Agreement and which prevent assets from being
subject to Security and such assets will be excluded from any relevant Security
document provided that all reasonable endeavours to obtain consent to subject
any such assets to Transaction Security shall be used by the relevant Obligor if
the relevant asset is material.

(c) Certain supervisory board, works council or other external body’s consent or
advice (as applicable) may be required to enable a member of the Group to
provide a guarantee or Security; such guarantee and/or Security shall not be
provided until such consent or advice (as applicable) has been received
**provided that reasonable endeavours have been used by the relevant member**
of the Group to obtain the relevant consent or advice (as applicable) to the extent
reasonably practicable and permissible by law, regulation and custom.

(d) In these Agreed Security Principles, cost is limited to, income tax cost,
notarisation, registration taxes payable on the creation or enforcement or for the
continuance of any guarantee and Security, stamp duties, out-of-pocket
expenses, and other fees and expenses directly incurred by the relevant grantor


-----

of the guarantee and Security or any of its direct or indirect owners, Subsidiaries
or Affiliates.

(e) “Enforcement Event” means the occurrence of a Declared Default.

2. **General**

(a) Where there is material incremental cost involved in creating Security the
principle stated at paragraph (iii) of paragraph 1 (Considerations) above shall
apply and, subject to these Agreed Security Principles, a cost/benefit-analysis
will be made by the Agent (acting reasonably and in consultation with the Parent)
in determining whether or not such asset shall be subject to Security.

(b) To the extent possible under applicable laws:

(i) the Security shall be enforceable on and from an Enforcement Event
occurring;

(ii) the Security will be first ranking, to the extent possible and subject to
any Security interest over the relevant asset which is expressly permitted
by the terms of this Agreement and which is already expressed to be first
ranking; and

(iii) to the extent possible and subject to any other legal requirement, the
documentation in respect of any Security granted by the Additional
Obligors shall mirror the documentation in respect of the Security
granted by the Original Obligors.

(c) The granting of guarantees, perfection of Security, when required, and other
legal formalities will be completed as soon as practicable and, in any event,
within the time periods specified in the relevant Finance Documents or (if
earlier or to the extent no such time periods are specified in the Finance
Documents) within the time periods specified by applicable law in order to
ensure due perfection.

(d) The provisions of each Transaction Security Document will not be unduly
burdensome on the Obligor or provider of that Security (in the case of Security
over shares) or interfere materially with the operation of its business (other than
any Transaction Security Document over Shareholder Loans which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall be perfected) and will be limited to those required to
create effective Security and not impose commercial obligations provided that
the Parent and each relevant member of the Group that has created Security over
its receivables shall use commercially reasonable endeavours to ensure that any
contract entered into by it does not contain provisions that restrict or prejudice
the effectiveness of that receivables Security or its enforcement.

(e) Information, such as lists of assets, will be provided only if mandatorily required
under applicable law.

(f) There shall be no rights for Secured Parties to exercise a power of attorney until
the occurrence of an Enforcement Event or failure by the relevant Obligor to


-----

perform a further assurance, registration or perfection obligation under or
relating to a Finance Document within 10 Business Days of written notice by
the Security Agent.

(g) To the extent possible, all Transaction Security shall be granted in favour of the
Security Agent acting on behalf of the Finance Parties individually and, if
customary in the relevant jurisdiction, in favour of the Finance Parties
represented by the Security Agent or each Lender from time to time (as relevant).
“Trust”, “parallel debt” or “joint and several creditorship” provisions will be
used where necessary; such provisions will be contained in the Intercreditor
Agreement unless required otherwise under applicable laws. To the extent
possible, no action shall be required in relation to the guarantees or Security
when any Lender transfers any of its participation in the Facilities to a new
Lender. If any action is required upon a transfer of participation, the transferring
Lender will bear all related costs and expenses (including stamp duties, taxes,
registration costs).

(h) Transaction Security, will where possible and practical, automatically create
Security over future assets of the same type as those already secured. Where
local law requires supplemental pledges to be delivered in respect of future
acquired assets in order for effective Security to be created over that class of
assets, supplemental pledges shall be provided no more frequently than annually
(unless expressly required more frequently under local law).

(i) Transaction Security Documents will not accrue interest on any amount in
respect of which interest is accruing under this Agreement.

(j) No Transaction Security will be granted over any trade receivables which
cannot be secured under the terms of the relevant contract provided that such
contract is entered into in the ordinary course of business on arm’s length terms
with a bona fide third party.

(k) Where an Obligor acquires assets of material value or significance for the
business of the Group after the date on which it initially grants Security, such
Obligor shall (unless existing Transaction Security automatically creates valid
Security over such assets) enter into security arrangements in accordance with
these Agreed Security Principles in respect of such assets if they are of a type
which, if owned at the date of this Agreement, would have been secured in
accordance with these Agreed Security Principles.

(l) Notwithstanding any other provision of any Finance Document:

(i) (other than any floating charge granted under an English law, or an Irish
law, governed global security document (and, for the avoidance of doubt,
any customary excluded assets consistent with these Agreed Security
Principles shall not be subject to such floating charge) and any security
granted pursuant to a New York law governed general security
agreement) the Transaction Security shall be limited to customary
Security over shares in Obligors and Material Subsidiaries which are
(subject to these Agreed Security Principles) required to accede as


-----

Guarantors, material intra-Group receivables owed to Obligors and
material bank accounts; and

(ii) no Security shall be granted by or over any Excluded Entity.

(m) Security shall not be granted by or over a member of the Group where that
member of the Group is a Regulated Group Company or is prohibited from
granting Security pursuant to the Regulatory Restrictions or is a general partner
of a fund. For the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph (m) shall not exclude the
grant of any other Security by Holding Companies of Regulated Group
Companies or general partners of funds.

(n) The guarantees and Security to be provided in support of the Facilities in
accordance with these Agreed Security Principles are only to be given by
members of the Group which are incorporated in a Security Jurisdiction and not
in any other jurisdiction, and (in respect of Security granted by the Parent under
the Transaction Security Documents provided pursuant to paragraph 3(a) of
Part A (Conditions Precedent to Signing the Agreement) of Schedule 2
(Conditions Precedent) and paragraph (a) of Clause 25.33 (Conditions
_Subsequent) only) the Parent._

(o) No guarantees shall be required to be given by and no Security shall be required
to be given by (or over shares, ownership interests or investments in) any person
incorporated in a jurisdiction other than a Security Jurisdiction.

3. **Shares**

(a) Security over shares will be provided in accordance with Part A (Conditions
_Precedent to Signing the Agreement) of Schedule 2 (Conditions Precedent) in_
respect of shares held in Obligors only.

(b) Until an Enforcement Event the company providing the relevant Security will
be permitted to retain and to exercise voting rights appertaining to any shares
charged by it.

(c) The Security Agent may only exercise the voting rights provided that:

(i) an Enforcement Event has occurred; and

(ii) the Security Agent notifies the provider of the relevant share Security
and the company whose shares are subject to the relevant share Security
that it seeks to exercise those voting rights.

(d) Until an Enforcement Event the company whose shares are subject to that
Security will be permitted to pay dividends upstream in respect of its shares to
the extent permitted under the Finance Documents.

(e) Where customary the share certificates (or other documents evidencing title to
the relevant shares) duly endorsed in blank together with, as applicable, a stock
transfer form executed in blank and (if required under local law) a copy of the


-----

share register where the Security has been registered will be provided to the
Security Agent.

4. **Intercompany receivables (other than Shareholder Loans)**

(a) Notification of Security over intercompany receivables (other than Shareholder
Loans) will be delivered within five Business Days of the Security being granted
and the Obligor shall procure that acknowledgement is obtained within 20
Business Days of service.

(b) Until an Enforcement Event the Obligor providing the Security is permitted to
receive any payment under its intercompany receivables to the extent permitted
under the Finance Documents.

(c) No intercompany receivables shall be evidenced by a negotiable instrument.

5. **Shareholder Loans**

(a) Security over the principal element of Shareholder Loans shall be perfected.

(b) Notification of Security over Shareholder Loans will be delivered on the date of
the security being granted and the Parent shall procure that acknowledgement
is obtained on the same day.

(c) Without prejudice to any payments or transactions, in each case, permitted
under the Finance Documents, until an Enforcement Event the Parent is
permitted to receive payment of accrued interest but not principal (including
compounded interest) under the Shareholder Loans to the extent permitted
under the Finance Documents.

(d) Copies of loan documents evidencing Shareholder Loans shall be delivered to
the Security Agent within the timeframes set out in the relevant Transaction
Security Document and no Shareholder Loan shall be evidenced by a negotiable
instrument.

6. **Bank accounts (including bank account receivables)**

(a) Until an Enforcement Event or as expressly agreed otherwise (for example in
relation to an account used for cash cover purpose) the Obligor providing the
Security is permitted to withdraw and transfer monies from the accounts to the
extent permitted or not expressly restricted under the Finance Documents.

(b) If required by or customary under local law to perfect the Security, notice of the
Security will be served on the account bank within five Business Days of the
Security being granted and the Obligor shall use its reasonable endeavours (not
involving the payment of money or incurrence of any external expenses) to
obtain an acknowledgement of that within 20 Business Days of service.

(c) Any obligation on the Obligor to use such reasonable endeavours to obtain an
acknowledgement from such bank of the notification shall cease on the expiry
of the above mentioned 20 Business Days period.


-----

(d) Irrespective of whether notice of the Security is required for perfection, if the
service of notice would prevent the Obligor from using a bank account in the
course of its business no notice of security shall be served until the occurrence
of an Enforcement Event.

(e) Any Security over bank accounts shall be subject to any prior Security interests
in favour of the account bank which are created either by law or in the standard
terms and conditions of the account bank or as part of the Group’s cash
management arrangements (provided that such arrangements constitute
Permitted Security).

(f) The notice of Security shall request such prior Security interests in favour of the
account bank to be waived by the account bank but the Obligor shall not be
required to change its banking arrangements if these Security interests are not
waived or only partially waived.

7. **Undertakings/Representations and Warranties**

(a) The Transaction Security Documents shall not operate so as to prevent
transactions which are permitted under this Agreement and shall not require
additional consents or authorisations unless such is required or customary under
applicable laws.

(b) The Transaction Security Documents will contain the market standard
representations, warranties or undertakings and to the extent possible under
applicable laws shall mirror the representations, warranties or undertakings as
included in the Transaction Security Documents of the Original Obligors.
Unless required by applicable law, the representations, warranties or
undertakings or other provisions contained in this Agreement or the
Intercreditor Agreement shall not be covered or duplicated in any Transaction
Security Document, unless required under applicable laws to perfect Security
that pursuant to these Agreed Security Principles shall be perfected.

8. **Accessions of Material Subsidiaries**

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, the Company is only obliged to perform its
obligations under Clause 25.30 (Material Subsidiaries) (i) if it is lawful for the
relevant person to become a Guarantor, (ii) if that person becoming a Guarantor
would not result in personal or criminal liability for that person’s directors,
officers or managers and/or (iii) if that person is not a Regulated Group
Company or a general partner of a fund.

(b) Each Obligor must use, and must procure that the relevant person uses, all
reasonable endeavours lawfully available to avoid any such unlawfulness or
personal liability. This includes agreeing to a limit on the amount guaranteed.
The Agent may (but shall not be obliged to) agree to such a limit if, in its opinion,
to do so would avoid the relevant unlawfulness or personal liability.
