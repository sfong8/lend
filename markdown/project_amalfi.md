pursuant to Clause 5.5 (Noteholders’ subscription) (an “Alternative Noteholder
**Funded Amount”), to assume an Original Facility Commitment in an amount equal**
to that Alternative Noteholder Funded Amount (an “Alternative Noteholder

Funded Amount (an “Alternative Noteholder Note Amount”), in each case in place
of the relevant Original Committed Noteholders;

(A) each Alternative Noteholder Assumed Commitment shall be attributed to the
relevant Electing Alternative Noteholder as if it had been an Original
Committed Noteholder in respect of that Alternative Noteholder Assumed
Commitment (and shall no longer be an Original Facility Commitment of the
relevant Original Committed Noteholder) and such Electing Alternative
Noteholders shall constitute an “Alternative Committed Noteholder”); and

(B) each Alternative Committed Noteholder shall assume all of the rights and
obligations as an Original Committed Noteholder in respect of the relevant
Alternative Noteholder Note Amount.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, if an Alternative Noteholder has not elected to fund an Alternative

Commitments.

obligations of any other Party under the Finance Documents. No Finance Party is responsible
for the obligations of any other Finance Party under the Finance Documents.

(b) The rights of each Finance Party under or in connection with the Finance Documents are
separate and independent rights and any debt arising under the Finance Documents to a
Finance Party from an Obligor is a separate and independent debt in respect of which a Finance
Party shall be entitled to enforce its rights in accordance with paragraph (c) below. The rights
of each Finance Party include any debt owing to that Finance Party under the Finance
Documents and, for the avoidance of doubt, any amounts in respect of the Notes or any other
amount owed by an Obligor which relates to a Finance Party’s Commitments or its role under

52


-----

a Finance Document (including any such amount payable to the Agent on its behalf) is a debt
owing to that Finance Party by that Obligor.

its behalf as its agent in relation to the Finance Documents and irrevocably authorises:

(i) the Issuer on its behalf to supply all information concerning itself contemplated by
this Agreement to the Finance Parties and to give all notices and instructions, to agree
the terms of any Incremental Facility and to deliver any Incremental Facility Notice,
to make such agreements and to effect the relevant amendments, supplements and
variations (in each case, however fundamental) capable of being given, made or
effected by any Obligor (notwithstanding that they may increase the Obligor's
obligations or otherwise affect the Obligor) and to give confirmation as to
continuation of surety obligations, without further reference to or the consent of that
Obligor; and

(ii) each Finance Party to give any notice, demand or other communication to that Obligor
pursuant to the Finance Documents to the Issuer,

and in each case the Obligor shall be bound as though the Obligor itself had given the notices
and instructions (including, without limitation, any Notes Subscription Requests) or executed
or made the agreements or effected the amendments, supplements or variations, or received
the relevant notice, demand or other communication.

(b) Every act, omission, agreement, undertaking, settlement, waiver, amendment, supplement,
variation, notice or other communication given or made by the Obligors' Agent or given to the
Obligors' Agent under any Finance Document on behalf of another Obligor or in connection
with any Finance Document (whether or not known to any other Obligor and whether
occurring before or after such other Obligor became an Obligor under any Finance Document)
shall be binding for all purposes on that Obligor as if that Obligor had expressly made, given
or concurred with it. In the event of any conflict between any notices or other communications
of the Obligors' Agent and any other Obligor, those of the Obligors' Agent shall prevail.

the funding of such redemption or prepayment would be reasonably likely to result in the directors or
other officers of that recipient incurring personal liability or a member of the Group incurring Tax
liability or transmission or foreign exchange cost which exceeds an amount equal to five per cent of
such prepayment. The Issuer shall procure that the members of the Group shall use all reasonable

**13.** **INTEREST**

**13.1** **Calculation of interest**

(a) The rate of interest on each Note for any day during an Interest Period is the percentage rate
per annum which is the aggregate of the applicable:

(i) Cash Pay Margin; and

(ii) PIK Margin.

**13.2** **Payment of cash pay interest**

Subject to Clause 13.3 (Blocked cash pay interest), the Issuer shall pay accrued Cash Pay Margin on

Issuer to pay the Cash Pay Margin on a Note pursuant to Clause 13.2 (Payment of cash pay
_interest) (a “Senior Blocking Event”) in whole or in part (such percentage of the Cash Pay_
Margin, the “Blocked PIK Percentage”), then the accrued interest on that Note in respect of
the Cash Pay Margin shall be the aggregate of:

(i) the Cash Pay Margin (as reduced by the Blocked PIK Percentage), which shall be paid
in cash; and

(ii) the Blocked PIK Percentage plus 0.25 per cent premium for each 1.00 per cent of
Blocked PIK Percentage, which shall be capitalised and treated as increasing the
principal amount of the relevant Note on which it accrues (the “Blocked PIK
**Interest”) (unless satisfied by the issue of PIK Notes pursuant to Clause 13.5 (PIK**
_Notes)),_

in each case, on the last day of the applicable Interest Period for that Note (and, if the Interest
Period is longer than six Months, on the dates falling at six Monthly intervals after the first
day of the Interest Period).

(b) Upon a Senior Blocking Event ceasing, and notwithstanding any other provision of this

accordance with Clause 9 (Redemption), Clause 10 (Illegality, Optional Redemption and
_Cancellation), Clause 11 (Mandatory Redemption and Cancellation) and Clause 26.19_
(Acceleration).

**13.4** **PIK Interest**

(a) In addition to the interest payable under Clause 13.2 (Payment of cash pay interest) and Clause
13.3 (Blocked cash pay interest), interest shall accrue on a daily basis on each Note at a
percentage rate per annum equal to the applicable PIK Margin and will capitalise on the last
day of each Interest Period and be added to the outstanding principal amount of the relevant
Note (the “PIK Interest”) unless satisfied by the issue of PIK Notes pursuant to Clause 13.5
(PIK Notes). Any interest shall after being capitalised, be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as part of the principal amount outstanding under the Note to which it relates and
shall be payable in accordance with Clause 9 (Redemption), Clause 10 (Illegality, Optional
_Redemption and Cancellation), Clause 11 (Mandatory Redemption and Cancellation) and_
Clause 26.19 (Acceleration).

relevant Interest Period, all amounts due in respect of each Note become immediately due and
payable under Clause 26.19 (Acceleration), or a Note is redeemed in full in accordance with
Clause 10 (Illegality, Optional Redemption and Cancellation) or Clause 11 (Mandatory
_Redemption and Cancellation) in which case such interest shall be paid at the same time as_
the redemption.

**13.5** **PIK Notes**

(a) The Issuer may satisfy any payment of PIK Interest or Blocked PIK Interest on the Notes by
the creation and issue of PIK Notes. PIK Interest and Blocked PIK Interest payments satisfied

of the relevant Notes (subject to, in the case of Blocked PIK Interest, Clause 13.3 (Blocked
_cash pay interest)) and any PIK Notes shall be issued to the Noteholders on a pro rata basis to_
the amounts of PIK Interest and Blocked PIK Interest owed to them. If the principal amount
of any PIK Notes to be issued in respect of accrued and unpaid PIK Interest and Blocked PIK
Interest is not a whole number, such amount shall be rounded downwards to the nearest pound.

(b) Any PIK Notes issued by the Issuer pursuant to paragraph (a) above shall be issued on
identical terms _mutatis mutandis to the Notes issued pursuant to, and constituted by, this_
Agreement (including, without limitation, in relation to the payment of interest, redemption
and Clause 15.6 (Redemption fees)).

**13.6** **Default Interest**

interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from the due date up to the date of actual payment
(both before and after judgment) at a rate which, subject to paragraph (b) below, is two per
cent. per annum higher than the rate which would have been payable if the overdue amount

(or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of a Tax Deduction) notify the Agent
accordingly. Similarly, a Noteholder shall notify the Agent on becoming so aware in respect
of a payment payable to that Noteholder. If the Agent receives such notification from a
Noteholder it shall notify the Issuer and that Obligor.

(c) If a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by an Obligor, the amount of the payment

(a) All amounts expressed to be payable under a Finance Document by any Party to a Finance
Party which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for any supply for VAT purposes
are deemed to be exclusive of any VAT which is chargeable on that supply, and accordingly,
subject to paragraph (b) below, if VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any
Finance Party to any Party under a Finance Document and such Finance Party is required to
account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT, that Party must pay to such Finance Party
(in addition to and at the same time as paying any other consideration for such supply) an

(b) If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Finance Party (the “Supplier”)
to any other Finance Party (the “Recipient”) under a Finance Document, and any Party other
than the Recipient (the “Relevant Party”) is required by the terms of any Finance Document

required to reimburse or indemnify the Recipient in respect of that consideration):

the VAT) the Relevant Party must also pay to the Supplier (at the same time as paying
that amount) an additional amount equal to the amount of the VAT. The Recipient
must (where this sub-paragraph (i) applies) promptly pay to the Relevant Party an
amount equal to any credit or repayment the Recipient receives from the relevant tax
authority which the Recipient reasonably determines relates to the VAT chargeable
on that supply; and

(ii) (where the Recipient is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for
the VAT) the Relevant Party must promptly, following demand from the Recipient,
pay to the Recipient an amount equal to the VAT chargeable on that supply but only
to the extent that the Recipient reasonably determines that it is not entitled to credit or
repayment from the relevant tax authority in respect of that VAT.

(c) Where a Finance Document requires any Party to reimburse or indemnify a Finance Party for
any cost or expense, that Party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case may be) such Finance
Party for the full amount of such cost or expense, including such part thereof as represents
VAT, save to the extent that such Finance Party reasonably determines that it is entitled to
credit or repayment in respect of such VAT from the relevant tax authority.

(d) Any reference in this Clause above to any Party shall, at any time when such Party is treated
as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and unless the context
otherwise requires) a reference to the representative member of such group at such time (the
term “representative member” to have the same meaning as in the Value Added Tax Act
1994).

(e) In relation to any supply made by a Finance Party to any Party under a Finance Document, if
reasonably requested by such Finance Party, that Party must promptly provide such Finance
Party with details of that Party’s VAT registration and such other information as is reasonably
requested in connection with such Finance Party’s VAT reporting requirements in relation to
such supply.

Party’s compliance with any other law, regulation, or exchange of information regime.

Exempt Party and it subsequently becomes aware that it is not or has ceased to be a FATCA
Exempt Party, that Party shall notify that other Party reasonably promptly.

(c) Paragraph (a) above shall not oblige any Finance Party to do anything, and paragraph (a)(iii)
above shall not oblige any other Party to do anything, which would or might in its reasonable
opinion constitute a breach of:

(i) any law or regulation;

(ii) any fiduciary duty; or

(iii) any duty of confidentiality.

(d) If a Party fails to confirm whether or not it is a FATCA Exempt Party or to supply forms,
documentation or other information requested in accordance with paragraphs (a)(i) or (a)(ii)
above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, where paragraph (c) above applies), then such
Party shall be treated for the purposes of the Finance Documents (and payments under them)
as if it is not a FATCA Exempt Party until such time as the Party in question provides the
requested confirmation, forms, documentation or other information.

**16.8** **FATCA Deduction**

(a) Each Party may make any FATCA Deduction it is required to make by FATCA, and any
payment required in connection with that FATCA Deduction, and no Party shall be required
to increase any payment in respect of which it makes such a FATCA Deduction or otherwise
compensate the recipient of the payment for that FATCA Deduction.

(b) Each Party shall promptly, upon becoming aware that it must make a FATCA Deduction (or

it incurs as a result of an Obligor not paying any amount which would, but for such

Document on the date when it would have been due and payable. The amount payable

security for those obligations or otherwise) is made by a Finance Party in whole or in part on the basis
of any payment, security or other disposition which is avoided or must be restored in insolvency,
liquidation, administration or otherwise, without limitation, then the liability of each Guarantor under
this Clause 21 will continue or be reinstated as if the discharge, release or arrangement had not
occurred.

**21.4** **Waiver of defences**

The obligations of each Guarantor under this Clause 21 will not be affected by an act, omission, matter
or thing which, but for this Clause 21, would reduce, release or prejudice any of its obligations under

(a) any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any Obligor or other person;

88


-----

arrangement with any creditor of any member of the Group;

(c) the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or release of, or refusal or neglect to
perfect, take up or enforce, any rights against, or security over assets of, any Obligor (other
than an express release of the relevant Senior Guarantor itself) or other person or any nonpresentation or non-observance of any formality or other requirement in respect of any
instrument or any failure to realise the full value of any security;

(d) any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of or dissolution or change in
the members or status of an Obligor or any other person;

amount made available under any of the Finance Documents for the purposes of or in connection with
any of the following: business acquisitions of any nature; increasing working capital; enabling investor
distributions to be made; carrying out restructurings; refinancing existing facilities; refinancing any
other indebtedness; making facilities available to new borrowers or issuers; any other variation or
extension of the purposes for which any such facility or amount might be made available from time to

**21.6** **Immediate recourse**

Each Guarantor waives any right it may have of first requiring any Finance Party (or any trustee or
agent on its behalf) to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or claim payment from
any person before claiming from that Guarantor under this Clause 21. This waiver applies irrespective
of any law or any provision of a Finance Document to the contrary.

**21.7** **Appropriations**

Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the
Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full, each Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on
its behalf) may:

(a) refrain from applying or enforcing any other moneys, security or rights held or received by
that Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect of those amounts, or apply
and enforce the same in such manner and order as it sees fit (whether against those amounts
or otherwise) and no Guarantor shall be entitled to the benefit of the same; and

(b) hold in an interest-bearing suspense account any moneys received from any Guarantor or on
account of any Guarantor’s liability under this Clause 21.

payment, or perform any obligation, in respect of which any Guarantor has given a
guarantee, undertaking or indemnity under Clause 21.1 (Guarantee and indemnity);

(vi) to claim or prove as a creditor of any Obligor in competition with any Finance Party.

(b) If a Guarantor receives any benefit, payment or distribution in relation to any rights referred
to in paragraph (a) above, it shall hold that benefit, payment or distribution to the extent
necessary to enable all amounts which may be or become payable to the Finance Parties by
the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents to be repaid in full on trust
for the Finance Parties and shall promptly pay or transfer the same to the Agent or as the Agent
may direct for application in accordance with Clause 33 (Payment Mechanics).

the terms of the Finance Documents then on the date such Retiring Guarantor ceases to be a Guarantor:

Document where such rights or security are granted by or in relation to the assets of the

of Clause 23.3 (Financial statements) above and/or each Compliance Certificate delivered
pursuant to Clause 23.4 (Provision and contents of Compliance Certificate).

116


-----

(b) So long as any cost savings or cost synergies included as Permitted Synergies are projected as
being realisable at any time during the Relevant Period, it may be assumed that such cost
savings or cost synergies will be realisable during the entire such period, provided that any
such pro forma increase to EBITDA shall be without duplication for cost savings or cost
synergies actually realised during such period and already included in EBITDA.

(c) Any component of EBITDA denominated in a currency other than the Base Currency shall be
converted into the Base Currency for the purpose of calculating EBITDA on the basis of the
exchange rate used in the relevant financial statements (consistently applied) and any
Borrowings denominated in a currency other than the Base Currency shall be converted into
the Base Currency for the purpose of calculating Total Net Debt on the basis of:

(i) where a member of the Midco Group has entered into a foreign exchange rate hedging
arrangement in respect of any Financial Indebtedness, the relevant fixed exchange rate
under such hedging arrangement to the extent of the amount of Financial Indebtedness
which is so hedged; or

in determining EBITDA for the Relevant Period in the relevant financial statements
(consistently applied).

(d) For the purpose of the financial covenant in Clause 24.3 (Financial condition) (and any other
calculation of Adjusted Leverage under this Agreement) for each of the Relevant Periods
ending on a date which is less than 12 months after the Closing Date, EBITDA shall be
calculated by reference to the period of 12 months ending on the last day of such Relevant
Period (and, where such 12 month period includes a period before the Closing Date, EBITDA
shall be determined by reference to the Target Group before such date).

**24.5** **Equity Cure**

(a) Subject to paragraphs (b) to (e) below, if an Event of Default occurs or the Issuer is concerned
that it would otherwise occur under Clause 26.2 (Financial covenant and other obligations)
in respect of a breach of Clause 24.3 (Financial condition) (a “Curable Default”), no Event
of Default will occur if:

(i) by no later than the date falling ten Business Days after the earlier of the date of the
Compliance Certificate evidencing the Curable Default and the date upon which such
Compliance Certificate should have been delivered under Clause 23 (Information
_Undertakings), the Issuer has notified the Agent that it intends to effect a cure pursuant_
to this Clause 24.5; and

(ii) by no later than the date falling 20 Business Days after the earlier of the date of the
Compliance Certificate evidencing the Curable Default and the date upon which such
Compliance Certificate should have been delivered under Clause 23 (Information
_Undertakings), the Issuer has received the proceeds of a New Shareholder Injection_
to be applied under this Clause 24.5 which are of a sufficient amount to remedy the
Curable Default (the amount of such received funds being the “Equity Cure
**Amount”) in accordance with paragraph (b) below.**

(b) Once the Equity Cure Amount has been received by the Issuer the financial covenant set out
in Clause 24.3 (Financial condition) shall be retested, at the Issuer’s election by either:

(i) deeming Borrowings under the Facilities to be decreased by such Equity Cure Amount
(pro rata across the Facilities) as of the first day of the Relevant Period in which the
Curable Default occurred, or the Issuer anticipated it would have occurred if this

117


-----

Clause 24.5 was not invoked, and, if and only to the extent that the Equity Cure
Amount remains on the Midco Group’s balance sheet as Cash or is invested as a Cash
Equivalent Investment, the next three Relevant Periods; or

(ii) subject to paragraph (e)(viii) below, once during the life of the Facilities only,
deeming EBITDA to be increased by an amount equal to (but, for the avoidance of
doubt, no greater than) the amount required to cure the Curable Default (such amount
being, the “Minimum Equity Cure Amount”) as of the first day of the Relevant
Period in which the Curable Default occurred, or the Issuer anticipated it would have
occurred if this Clause 24.5 was not invoked, and the next three Relevant Periods.

(c) If, after Borrowings are deemed decreased, or (as applicable) EBITDA is increased under
paragraph (b) above, the financial covenant is complied with, and the Issuer shall be deemed
to have satisfied the requirements of the financial covenant as of the relevant testing dates with
the same effect as if there had been no breach of that financial covenant and, if applicable, that
Curable Default shall be deemed remedied for all purposes under the Finance Documents.

(d) The Midco Group may only exercise its rights under paragraph (a) above:

(i) four times before the Termination Date; and

(ii) (without prejudice to the deemed application of an Equity Cure Amount in respect of
three further Relevant Periods referred to in paragraph (b) above in respect of any
Curable Default pursuant to Clause 24.3 (Financial condition)) not in respect of two
consecutive Relevant Periods.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt:

(i) if within 20 Business Days of the earlier of the date of the Compliance Certificate
evidencing the Curable Default or the date upon which such Compliance Certificate
should have been delivered under Clause 23 (Information Undertakings), the Issuer
has not received sufficient of the funds referred to in paragraph (a) above to remedy
the relevant Curable Default in accordance with this Clause 24.5, the Finance Parties
will be permitted to take any action available to them specified in Clause 26.19
(Acceleration) immediately upon the expiry of that period;

(ii) this Clause 24.5 shall not restrict the ability of any Finance Party to take action under
Clause 26.19 (Acceleration) in respect of any other Event of Default which is not a
Curable Default being remedied in accordance with paragraph (a) above;

(iii) save as contemplated in paragraph (vi) below, no part of the Equity Cure Amount
shall be required to be applied in redemption of the Notes;

(iv) where the Issuer has elected to apply the Equity Cure Amount as contemplated by
paragraph (b)(i) above, there shall be no limit on the amount of the Equity Cure
Amount;

(v) where the Issuer has elected to apply the Minimum Equity Cure Amount as
contemplated by paragraph (b)(ii) above but the relevant Equity Cure Amount is
greater than the Minimum Equity Cure Amount, EBITDA shall only be increased by
an amount equal to the Minimum Equity Cure Amount, and the difference between
the Equity Cure Amount and the Minimum Equity Cure Amount shall be deemed to
reduce Borrowings in accordance with paragraph (b)(i) above;

118


-----

(vi) any recalculation of the financial covenant in Clause 24.3 (Financial condition) made
under this Clause 24.5 will be solely for the purpose of curing a relevant breach of
that paragraph and not for any other purpose, including (without limitation) the
calculation of PIK Margin, in the definitions of Permitted Payment or Permitted
Acquisition;

(vii) there shall be no double counting under this Clause 24.5 in respect of any Equity Cure
Amount received by the Midco Group (including, without limitation, in respect of any
voluntary prepayment of some or all of the Equity Cure Amount or any Equity Cure
Amount that remains on balance sheet as Cash or which has been invested as a Cash
Equivalent Investment);

(viii) no Default or Material Event of Default shall arise in relation to the financial
covenants in Clause 24.3 (Financial condition) between the date of delivery of the
relevant Compliance Certificate and the end of the period referred to in paragraph (a)
above; and

(ix) an exercise by a member of the Midco Group of its rights under clause 26.4 (Equity
_Cure) of the Senior Facilities Agreement shall count as an exercise of its rights under_
paragraph (a) of this Clause 24.5.

**24.6** **Deemed Remedy**

(a) If the Issuer is in breach of any of its obligations under Clause 24.3 (Financial condition) in
respect of a Relevant Period (the “First Period”) but the Issuer is in compliance with all its
obligations under Clause 24.3 (Financial condition) in respect of the next Relevant Period (the
“Second Period”) (ignoring for this purpose any applications of Clause 24.5 (Equity Cure) to
that Second Period) and the Agent (acting on behalf of the Noteholders) has not exercised any
of the rights set out in Clause 26.19 (Acceleration), then the breach of such obligations in
respect of the First Period shall be deemed remedied for the purposes of Clause 24.3
(Financial condition).

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, subject to Clause 24.5 (Equity Cure), any breach referred to in

132


-----

(v) not discontinue the use of the Intellectual Property,

where failure to do so, in the case of paragraphs (a)(i) to (a)(iii) above, or, in the case of

to the extent any voting rights are transferred or are capable of being transferred by the
Noteholder, paragraph (b) below is complied with.

147


-----

on any information provided to it by the Existing Noteholder or any other Finance
Party in connection with any Transaction Document or the Transaction Security; and

(ii) will continue to make its own independent appraisal of the creditworthiness of each
Obligor and its related entities whilst any amount is or may be outstanding under the
Finance Documents or any Commitment is in force.

(c) Nothing in any Finance Document obliges an Existing Noteholder to:

(i) accept a re-transfer from a New Noteholder of any of the rights and obligations
transferred under this Clause 27; or

(ii) support any losses directly or indirectly incurred by the New Noteholder by reason of
the non-performance by any Obligor of its obligations under the Transaction
Documents or otherwise.

**27.8** **Procedure for transfer**

(a) Subject to the conditions set out in Clause 27.2 (The Issuer consent) and Clause 27.3 (Other

Notes held by the Existing Noteholder.

(d) Subject to Clause 27.11 (Pro rata interest settlement), on the Transfer Date:

and in respect of the Transaction Security and their respective rights against one
another under the Finance Documents and in respect of the Transaction Security shall
be cancelled (being the “Discharged Rights and Obligations”);

(ii) each of the Obligors and the New Noteholder shall assume obligations towards one
another and/or acquire rights against one another which differ from the Discharged
Rights and Obligations only insofar as that Obligor and the New Noteholder have
assumed and/or acquired the same in place of that Obligor and the Existing
Noteholder;

(iii) the Agent, the Security Agent, the Arrangers, the New Noteholder and the other
Noteholders shall acquire the same rights and assume the same obligations between
themselves and in respect of the Transaction Security as they would have acquired
and assumed had the New Noteholder been an Original Noteholder with the rights,
and/or obligations acquired or assumed by it as a result of the transfer and to that
extent the Agent, the Security Agent, the Arrangers and the Existing Noteholder shall
each be released from further obligations to each other under the Finance Documents;

Finance Document to secure obligations of that Noteholder including, without limitation:

(a) any charge, assignment or other Security to secure obligations to a federal reserve, central
bank or governmental authority; and

(b) any charge, assignment or other Security granted to any holders (or trustee or representatives

(c) except that no such charge, assignment or Security shall:

(i) release a Noteholder from any of its obligations under the Finance Documents or
substitute the beneficiary of the relevant charge, assignment or Security for the
Noteholder as a party to any of the Finance Documents; or

(ii) require any payments to be made by an Obligor other than or in excess of, or grant to
any person any more extensive rights than, those required to be made or granted to
the relevant Noteholder under the Finance Documents.

**27.11** **Pro rata interest settlement**

(a) If the Agent has notified the Noteholders that it is able to distribute interest payments on a pro
_rata_ basis to Existing Noteholders and New Noteholders then (in respect of any transfer
pursuant to Clause 27.8 (Procedure for transfer) the Transfer Date of which, in each case, is
after the date of such notification and is not on the last day of an Interest Period):

(i) any interest or fees in respect of the relevant holding which are expressed to accrue
by reference to the lapse of time shall continue to accrue in favour of the Existing
Noteholder up to but excluding the Transfer Date (“Accrued Amounts”) and shall
become due and payable to the Existing Noteholder (without further interest accruing
on them) on the last day of the current Interest Period; and

which would, but for the application of this Clause, have been payable to it
on that date, but after deduction of the Accrued Amounts.

(b) In this Clause references to “Interest Period” shall be construed to include a reference to any
other period for accrual of fees.

(c) An Existing Noteholder which retains the right to the Accrued Amounts pursuant to this
Clause but which does not have a Commitment shall be deemed not to be a Noteholder for the
purposes of ascertaining whether the agreement of any specified group of Noteholders has
been obtained to approve any request for a consent, waiver, amendment or other vote of
Noteholders under the Finance Documents.

**28.** **RESTRICTION ON DEBT PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS**

The Issuer shall not, and Topco shall procure that no other member of the Group shall:

(d) If the Agent wishes to resign because (acting reasonably) it has concluded that it is no longer
appropriate for it to remain as agent and the Agent is entitled to appoint a successor Agent
under paragraph (c) above, the Agent may (if it concludes (acting reasonably) that it is
necessary to do so in order to persuade the proposed successor Agent to become a party to this
Agreement as Agent) agree with the proposed successor Agent amendments to this
Clause 30.12 and any other term of this Agreement dealing with the rights or obligations of
the Agent consistent with then current market practice for the appointment and protection of
corporate trustees together with any reasonable amendments to the agency fee payable under
this Agreement which are consistent with the successor Agent’s normal fee rates and those
amendments will bind the Parties.

Noteholder reasonably believes that the Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be)
a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA Application Date;

(ii) the information supplied by the Agent pursuant to Clause 16.7 (FATCA information)
indicates that the Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party

have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA Application Date;

**30.13** **Replacement of the Agent**

(a) After consultation with the Issuer, the Majority Noteholders may, by giving 30 days’ notice

**32.1** **Payments to Finance Parties**

If a Finance Party (a “Recovering Finance Party”) receives or recovers any amount from an Obligor
other than in accordance with Clause 33 (Payment Mechanics) (a “Recovered Amount”) and applies
that amount to a payment due under the Finance Documents then:

(a) the Recovering Finance Party shall, within three Business Days, notify details of the receipt
or recovery, to the Agent;

(b) the Agent shall determine whether the receipt or recovery is in excess of the amount the
Recovering Finance Party would have been paid had the receipt or recovery been received or
made by the Agent and distributed in accordance with Clause 33 (Payment Mechanics),
without taking account of any Tax which would be imposed on the Agent in relation to the
receipt, recovery or distribution; and

(c) the Recovering Finance Party shall, within three Business Days of demand by the Agent, pay
to the Agent an amount (the “Sharing Payment”) equal to such receipt or recovery less any
amount which the Agent determines may be retained by the Recovering Finance Party as its
share of any payment to be made, in accordance with Clause 33.6 (Partial payments).

**32.2** **Redistribution of payments**

The Agent shall treat the Sharing Payment as if it had been paid by the relevant Obligor and distribute
it between the Finance Parties (other than the Recovering Finance Party) (the “Sharing Finance
**Parties”) in accordance with Clause 33.6 (Partial payments) towards the obligations of that Obligor**
to the Sharing Finance Parties.

**32.3** **Recovering Finance Party’s rights**

On a distribution by the Agent under Clause 32.2 (Redistribution of payments) of a payment received
by a Recovering Finance Party from an Obligor, as between the relevant Obligor and the Recovering
Finance Party, an amount of the Recovered Amount equal to the Sharing Payment will be treated as
not having been paid by that Obligor.

**32.4** **Reversal of redistribution**

If any part of the Sharing Payment received or recovered by a Recovering Finance Party becomes
repayable and is repaid by that Recovering Finance Party, then:

163


-----

(a) each Sharing Finance Party shall, upon request of the Agent, pay to the Agent for the account
of that Recovering Finance Party an amount equal to the appropriate part of its share of the
Sharing Payment (together with an amount as is necessary to reimburse that Recovering
Finance Party for its proportion of any interest on the Sharing Payment which that Recovering
Finance Party is required to pay) (the “Redistributed Amount”); and

(b) as between the relevant Obligor and each relevant Sharing Finance Party, an amount equal to
the relevant Redistributed Amount will be treated as not having been paid by that Obligor.

**32.5** **Exceptions**

(a) This Clause 32 shall not apply to the extent that the Recovering Finance Party would not, after
making any payment pursuant to this Clause, have a valid and enforceable claim against the
relevant Obligor.

(b) A Recovering Finance Party is not obliged to share with any other Finance Party any amount
which the Recovering Finance Party has received or recovered as a result of taking legal or
arbitration proceedings, if:

(i) it notified the other Finance Party of the legal or arbitration proceedings; and

(ii) the other Finance Party had an opportunity to participate in those legal or arbitration
proceedings but did not do so as soon as reasonably practicable having received notice
and did not take separate legal or arbitration proceedings.

**33.** **PAYMENT MECHANICS**

**33.1** **Payments to the Agent**

(a) On each date on which an Obligor or a Noteholder is required to make a payment under a
Finance Document that Obligor or Noteholder shall make the same available to the Agent
(unless a contrary indication appears in a Finance Document) for value on the due date at the
time and in such funds specified by the Agent as being customary at the time for settlement of
transactions in the relevant currency in the place of payment.

(b) Payment shall be made to such account in the principal financial centre of the country of that
currency (or, in relation to euro, in a principal financial centre in such Participating Member
State or London, as specified by the Agent) and with such bank as the Agent, in each case,
specifies.

**33.2** **Distributions by the Agent**

Each payment received by the Agent under the Finance Documents for another Party shall, subject to
Clause 33.3 (Distributions to an Obligor) and Clause 33.4 (Clawback and pre-funding) be made
available by the Agent as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt to the Party entitled to receive
payment in accordance with this Agreement (in the case of a Noteholder, for the account of its Facility
Office), to such account as that Party may notify to the Agent by not less than five Business Days’
notice with a bank specified by that Party in the principal financial centre of the country of that
currency (or, in relation to euro, in the principal financial centre of a Participating Member State or
London, as specified by that Party).

**33.3** **Distributions to an Obligor**

The Agent may (with the consent of the Obligor or in accordance with Clause 34 (Set-off)) apply any
amount received by it for that Obligor in or towards payment (on the date and in the currency and

164


-----

funds of receipt) of any amount due from that Obligor under the Finance Documents or in or towards
purchase of any amount of any currency to be so applied.

**33.4** **Clawback and pre-funding**

(a) Where a sum is to be paid to the Agent under the Finance Documents for another Party, the
Agent is not obliged to pay that sum to that other Party (or to enter into or perform any related
exchange contract) until it has been able to establish to its satisfaction that it has actually
received that sum.

(b) Unless paragraph (c) below applies, if the Agent pays an amount to another Party and it proves
to be the case that the Agent had not actually received that amount, then the Party to whom
that amount (or the proceeds of any related exchange contract) was paid by the Agent shall on
demand refund the same to the Agent together with interest on that amount from the date of
payment to the date of receipt by the Agent, calculated by the Agent to reflect its cost of funds.

(c) If the Agent has notified the Noteholders that it is willing to make available amounts for the
account of the Issuer before receiving funds from the Noteholders then if and to the extent that
the Agent does so but it proves to be the case that it does not then receive funds from a
Noteholder in respect of a sum which it paid to the Issuer:

(i) the Agent shall notify the Issuer of that Noteholder’s identity and the Issuer shall on
demand refund it to the Agent; and

(ii) the Noteholder by whom those funds should have been made available or, if that
Noteholder fails to do so, the Issuer shall on demand pay to the Agent the amount (as
certified by the Agent) which will indemnify the Agent against any funding cost
incurred by it as a result of paying out that sum before receiving those funds from that
Noteholder.

**33.5** **Impaired Agent**

(a) If, at any time, the Agent becomes an Impaired Agent, an Obligor or a Noteholder which is
required to make a payment under the Finance Documents to the Agent in accordance with
Clause 33.1 (Payments to the Agent) may instead either:

(i) pay that amount direct to the required recipient(s); or

(ii) if in its absolute discretion it considers that it is not reasonably practicable to pay that
amount direct to the required recipient(s), pay that amount or the relevant part of that
amount to an interest-bearing account held with an Acceptable Bank within the
meaning of paragraph (a) of the definition of Acceptable Bank and in relation to which
no Insolvency Event has occurred and is continuing, in the name of the Obligor or the
Noteholder making the payment (the “Paying Party”) and designated as a trust
account for the benefit of the Party or Parties beneficially entitled to that payment
under the Finance Documents (the “Recipient Party” or “Recipient Parties”).

In each case such payments must be made on the due date for payment under the Finance
Documents

(b) All interest accrued on the amount standing to the credit of the trust account shall be for the
benefit of the Recipient Party or Recipient Parties pro rata to their respective entitlements.

165


-----

(c) A Party which has made a payment in accordance with these paragraphs (a) to (d) shall be
discharged of the relevant payment obligation under the Finance Documents and shall not take
any credit risk with respect to the amounts standing to the credit of the trust account.

(d) Promptly upon the appointment of a successor Agent in accordance with Clause 30.13
(Replacement of the Agent), each Paying Party shall (other than to the extent that that Party
has given an instruction pursuant to paragraph (e) below) give all requisite instructions to the
bank with whom the trust account is held to transfer the amount (together with any accrued
interest) to the successor Agent for distribution to the relevant Recipient Party or Recipient
Parties in accordance with Clause 33.2 (Distributions by the Agent).

(e) A Paying Party shall, promptly upon request by a Recipient Party and to the extent:

(i) that it has not given an instruction pursuant to paragraph (d) above; and

(ii) that it has been provided with the necessary information by that Recipient Party,

give all requisite instructions to the bank with whom the trust account is held to transfer the
relevant amount (together with any accrued interest) to that Recipient Party.

**33.6** **Partial payments**

(a) If the Agent receives a payment for application against amounts due in respect of any Finance
Documents that is insufficient to discharge all the amounts then due and payable by an Obligor
under those Finance Documents, the Agent shall apply that payment towards the obligations
of that Obligor under those Finance Documents in the following order:

(i) **first, in or towards payment pro rata of any unpaid fees, costs and expenses owing to**
the Agent, the Security Agent under the Finance Documents;

(ii) **secondly, in or towards payment pro rata of any principal outstanding, accrued**
