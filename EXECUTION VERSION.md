assume all the obligations of a Lender corresponding to that part of the

Lender which the Agent shall, if all applicable conditions set out in this Clause are 
satisfied, execute promptly on request;
(ii)in relation to an Increase Lender which is not a Lender immediately prior to the 
relevant increase:

the Increase Lender and, if the increase is to the Commitments under a 
Revolving Facility each applicable Issuing Bank.
(c) Each Increase Lender, by executing the Increase Confirmation, confirms (for the avoidance 
of doubt) that the Agent has authority to execute on its behalf any amendment or waiver</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 88 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreementthat has been approved by or on behalf of the requisite Lender or Lenders in accordance

the amount and at the times agreed between the Company (or another member of the Group) 
and the Increase Lender in a Fee Letter.

(b) The rights of each Finance Party under or in connection with the Finance Documents are 
separate and independent rights and any debt arising under the Finance Documents to a

The rights of each Finance Party include any debt owing to that Finance Party under the 
Finance Documents and, for the avoidance of doubt, any part of a Loan or any other amount 
owed by an Obligor which relates to a Finance Party's participation in a Facility or its role 
under a Finance Document (including any such amount payable to the Agent on its behalf) 
is a debt owing to that Finance Party by that Obligor.
(c) A Finance Party may, except as otherwise stated in the Finance Documents, separately 
enforce its rights under the Finance Documents.

shall:
(i)participate therein in compliance with the terms of this Agreement;

Lender&quot; by delivery of a duly completed &quot;Creditor/Agent Accession Undertaking&quot;

(c) Each Lender shall remain liable and responsible for the performance of all obligations 
assumed by a Designated Affiliate on its behalf under this Clause 2.5 and non-performance 
of a Lender's obligations by its Designated Affiliate following a nomination under this 
Clause 2.5 shall not relieve such Lender from its obligations under this Agreement (but 
without prejudice to a Lender's rights under Clause 29 (Changes to the Lenders)).
(d) No Obligor shall be liable to pay (i) any amount otherwise required to be paid by an Obligor 
under Clause 18 (Taxes) or Clause 19.1 ( Increased costs) (arising as a result of laws or 
regulations in force or known to be coming into force on the date the relevant branch or 
Affiliate was nominated) or (ii) any cash repayment of a Loan to the extent that paragraph 
(b) of Clause 10.3 ( Repayment of Revolving Facility Loans) would otherwise apply to such 
Loan, in each case in excess of the amount it would have been obliged to pay if that Lender 
had not nominated its branch or Affiliate to participate in the Facility or, to the extent that 
such Lender nominated such branch or Affiliate for particular Loans in the Transfer 
Certificate or Assignment Agreement pursuant to which such Lender became a Party, in 
excess of the amount which it would have been obliged to pay had that Lender continued 
to make only those particular Loans through that branch or Affiliate. Each Lender shall 
promptly notify the Agent and the Company of the Tax jurisdiction from which its branch 
or Affiliate will participate in the relevant Loans and such other information regarding that 
branch or Affiliate as the Company may reasonably request.
(e) Any notice or communication to be made to a branch or an Affiliate of a Lender pursuant 
to Clause 37 (Notices):
(i)may be served directly upon the branch or Affiliate, at the address supplied to the 
Agent by the nominating Lender pursuant to its nomination of such branch or 
Affiliate, where the Lender or the relevant branch or Affiliate requests this in order 
to mitigate any legal obligation to deduct Tax from any payment to such branch or 
Affiliate or any payment obligation which might otherwise arise pursuant to 
Clause 18 (Taxes) or Clause 19 (Increased Costs); or
(ii)in any other circumstance, may be delivered to the Facility Office of the Lender, 
who will act as the representative of any Affiliate it nominates for all 
administrative purposes under this Agreement.
(f) If a Lender nominates an Affiliate, that Lender and that Affiliate:
(i)will be treated as having a single Commitment (being the Commitment of that 
Lender) but for all other purposes (other than those referred to in paragraphs (c)</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 90 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreementand (e)(i) above and sub-paragraph (ii) below) will be treated as separate Lenders; 
and
(ii)will be regarded as a single Lender for the purpose of:
(A) voting in relation to any matter in connection with a Finance Document; 
and
(B) compliance with Clause 29.2 (Assignments and Transfers by Lenders).
(g) The Obligors, the Agent, the Security Agent and the other Finance Parties will be entitled 
to deal only with the designating Lender, except all payments of principal, interest, fees, 
costs, Taxes and commissions in connection with a Designated Loan shall be for the 
account of the relevant Designated Affiliate. For the avoidance of doubt, this shall not apply 
to any commitment fee which shall be for the account of the relevant Lender.
(h) A Lender that has made a nomination in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (g) above may 
revoke such nomination in relation to any future Loans by giving the Agent at least five (5) 
Business Days' written notice.
(i) Upon such Designated Affiliate ceasing to be a Designated Affiliate, the Lender will 
automatically assume (and be deemed to assume without further action by any Party) all 
rights and obligations previously vested in the Designated Affiliate.
(j) This Clause 2.5 is without prejudice to a Lender's right to Transfer its Commitments to an 
Affiliate under Clause 29 (Changes to the Lenders).
2.6 Obligors' Agent
(a) To the extent permitted under any applicable law, each Obligor (other than the Obligors' 
Agent), by its execution of this Agreement or an Accession Deed, irrevocably (to the extent 
permitted by law) appoints the Obligors' Agent to act severally on its behalf as its agent in 
relation to the Finance Documents and irrevocably (to the extent permitted by law)

Documents, to agree to any Additional Facility terms, to deliver Additional 
Facility Notices, to make such agreements and to effect the relevant amendments, 
supplements and variations capable of being given, made or effected by any 
Obligor, notwithstanding that they may affect the Obligor, without further 
reference to or the consent of that Obligor; and
(ii)each Finance Party to give any notice, demand or other communication to that 
Obligor pursuant to the Finance Documents to the Obligors' Agent,
and in each case the Obligor shall be bound as though the Obligor itself had given the 
notices and instructions (including any Utilisation Requests and/or Selection Notices) or 
executed or made the agreements or effected the amendments, supplements or variations, 
or received the relevant notice, demand or other communication and each Finance Party 
may rely on any action taken by the Obligors' Agent on behalf of that Obligor.
(b) Every act, omission, agreement, undertaking, settlement, waiver, amendment, supplement, 
variation, notice or other communication given or made by the Obligors' Agent or given to 
the Obligors' Agent under any Finance Document on behalf of another Obligor or in</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 91 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreementconnection with any Finance Document (whether or not known to any other Obligor and 
whether occurring before or after such other Obligor became an Obligor under any Finance 
Document shall be binding for all purposes on that Obligor as if that Obligor had expressly 
made, given or concurred with it (to the extent permitted by law)). In the event of any 
conflict between any notices or other communications of the Obligors' Agent and any other 
Obligor, those of the Obligors' Agent shall prevail.
(c) For the purpose of this Clause 2.6, each Obligor (to the extent necessary under applicable 
law) shall grant a specific power of attorney (notarized and apostilled) to the Obligors' 
Agent and comply with any necessary formalities in connection therewith.
