(ii) by no later than the date falling 25 Business Days after the earlier of the date
of the Compliance Certificate evidencing the Curable Default and the date
upon which such Compliance Certificate should have been delivered under
clause 25 (Information undertakings), the Company has received the
proceeds of a New Shareholder Injection to be applied under this clause 26.4
which are of a sufficient amount to remedy the Curable Default (the amount
of such received funds being the ""Equity Cure Amount"") in accordance with
paragraph (b) below.

(b) Once the Equity Cure Amount has been received by the Company the financial
covenants set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 26.2 (Financial condition) shall
be retested, at the Parent's election by either:

(i) deeming Borrowings under the Facilities to be decreased by such Equity Cure
Amount (pro rata across the Facilities) as of the first day of the Relevant
Period in which the Curable Default occurred, or the Parent anticipated it
would have occurred if this clause was not invoked, and, if and only to the
extent that the Equity Cure Amount remains on the Group's balance sheet as
Cash or is invested as a Cash Equivalent Investment, the next three Relevant
Periods; or

(ii) subject to paragraph (e)(viii) below, once during the life of the Facilities only,

Default (such amount being, the ""Minimum Equity Cure Amount"") as of
the first day of the Relevant Period in which the Curable Default occurred, or
the Parent anticipated it would have occurred if this clause was not invoked,
and the next three Relevant Periods.

(c) If, after Borrowings are deemed decreased, or (as applicable) EBITDA is increased
under paragraph (b) above, the financial covenants are complied with, the Parent
shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of the financial covenants as of
the relevant testing dates with the same effect as if there had been no breach of
those financial covenants and, if applicable, that Curable Default shall be deemed
remedied for all purposes under the Finance Documents.

(d) The Group may only exercise its rights under paragraph (a) above:

(i) four times before the Termination Date of the Super Senior Term Facility; and

(ii) (without prejudice to the deemed application of an Equity Cure Amount in

(i) if within 25 Business Days of the earlier of the date of the Compliance
Certificate evidencing the Curable Default or the date upon which such
Compliance Certificate should have been delivered under clause 25

funds referred to in paragraph (a) above to remedy the relevant Curable
Default in accordance with this clause 26.4, the Finance Parties will be

under clause 28.18 (Acceleration) in respect of any other Event of Default, or
under clause 28.19 (Super Senior Acceleration) in respect of any other
Material Event of Default, in each case which is not a Curable Default being
remedied in accordance with paragraph (a) above;

(iii) any Equity Cure Amount shall be applied as contemplated by paragraph (b)
above even if the Parent may have complied with one or more of the financial
covenants in clause 26.2 (Financial condition) in the absence of such
application, provided that:

(A) such Equity Cure Amount applied in respect of any Curable Default
pursuant to paragraph (a) of clause 26.2 (Financial condition) shall be
applied in the same way in respect of paragraph (b) of clause 26.2
(Financial condition);

(B) its application in respect of paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 26.2
(Financial condition) shall count only as one exercise of its rights under
paragraph (a) above; and

(C) where the Parent has elected to apply the Minimum Equity Cure
Amount as contemplated by paragraph (b)(ii) above, its application in
respect of paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 26.2 (Financial condition)
shall count only as one exercise of its rights under paragraph (b)(ii)
above;

(iv) save as contemplated in paragraph (vi) below, no part of the Equity Cure
Amount shall be required to be applied in prepayment of the Facilities;

(v) where the Parent has elected to apply the Equity Cure Amount as
contemplated by paragraph (b)(i) above, there shall be no limit on the amount
of the Equity Cure Amount;

(vi) where the Parent has elected to apply the Minimum Equity Cure Amount as
contemplated by paragraph (b)(ii) above but the relevant Equity Cure Amount
is greater than the Minimum Equity Cure Amount, EBITDA shall only be
increased by an amount equal to the Minimum Equity Cure Amount, and the
difference between the Equity Cure Amount and the Minimum Equity Cure
Amount shall be deemed to reduce Borrowings in accordance with paragraph
(b)(i) above;

(vii) any recalculation of the financial covenants in paragraphs (a) or (b) of clause
26.2 (Financial condition) made under this clause 26.4 will be solely for the
purpose of curing a relevant breach of that paragraph and not for any other
purpose, including (without limitation) the calculation of Margin, in the
definitions of Permitted Payment or Permitted Acquisition, the calculation of
the Listing Proceeds to be applied in mandatory prepayment of the Facility in
clause 11 (Mandatory prepayment and cancellation), any Utilisation of the
Incremental Term Facility;

(viii) there shall be no double counting under this clause 26.4 in respect of any
Equity Cure Amount received by the Group (including, without limitation, in
respect of any voluntary prepayment of some or all of the Equity Cure Amount
or any Equity Cure Amount that remains on balance sheet as Cash or which
has been invested as a Cash Equivalent Investment); and

(ix) no Default or Material Event of Default shall arise in relation to the financial
covenants in paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 26.2 (Financial condition)
