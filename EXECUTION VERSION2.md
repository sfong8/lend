assume all the obligations of a Lender corresponding to that part of the

Lender which the Agent shall, if all applicable conditions set out in this Clause are 
satisfied, execute promptly on request;
(ii)in relation to an Increase Lender which is not a Lender immediately prior to the 
relevant increase:

the Increase Lender and, if the increase is to the Commitments under a 
Revolving Facility each applicable Issuing Bank.
(c) Each Increase Lender, by executing the Increase Confirmation, confirms (for the avoidance 
of doubt) that the Agent has authority to execute on its behalf any amendment or waiver</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 88 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreementthat has been approved by or on behalf of the requisite Lender or Lenders in accordance

the amount and at the times agreed between the Company (or another member of the Group) 
and the Increase Lender in a Fee Letter.

(b) The rights of each Finance Party under or in connection with the Finance Documents are 
separate and independent rights and any debt arising under the Finance Documents to a

The rights of each Finance Party include any debt owing to that Finance Party under the 
Finance Documents and, for the avoidance of doubt, any part of a Loan or any other amount 
owed by an Obligor which relates to a Finance Party's participation in a Facility or its role 
under a Finance Document (including any such amount payable to the Agent on its behalf) 
is a debt owing to that Finance Party by that Obligor.
(c) A Finance Party may, except as otherwise stated in the Finance Documents, separately 
enforce its rights under the Finance Documents.

shall:
(i)participate therein in compliance with the terms of this Agreement;

Lender&quot; by delivery of a duly completed &quot;Creditor/Agent Accession Undertaking&quot;

(c) Each Lender shall remain liable and responsible for the performance of all obligations 
assumed by a Designated Affiliate on its behalf under this Clause 2.5 and non-performance 
of a Lender's obligations by its Designated Affiliate following a nomination under this 
Clause 2.5 shall not relieve such Lender from its obligations under this Agreement (but 
without prejudice to a Lender's rights under Clause 29 (Changes to the Lenders)).
(d) No Obligor shall be liable to pay (i) any amount otherwise required to be paid by an Obligor 
under Clause 18 (Taxes) or Clause 19.1 ( Increased costs) (arising as a result of laws or 
regulations in force or known to be coming into force on the date the relevant branch or 
Affiliate was nominated) or (ii) any cash repayment of a Loan to the extent that paragraph 
(b) of Clause 10.3 ( Repayment of Revolving Facility Loans) would otherwise apply to such 
Loan, in each case in excess of the amount it would have been obliged to pay if that Lender 
had not nominated its branch or Affiliate to participate in the Facility or, to the extent that 
such Lender nominated such branch or Affiliate for particular Loans in the Transfer 
Certificate or Assignment Agreement pursuant to which such Lender became a Party, in 
excess of the amount which it would have been obliged to pay had that Lender continued 
to make only those particular Loans through that branch or Affiliate. Each Lender shall 
promptly notify the Agent and the Company of the Tax jurisdiction from which its branch 
or Affiliate will participate in the relevant Loans and such other information regarding that 
branch or Affiliate as the Company may reasonably request.
(e) Any notice or communication to be made to a branch or an Affiliate of a Lender pursuant 
to Clause 37 (Notices):
(i)may be served directly upon the branch or Affiliate, at the address supplied to the 
Agent by the nominating Lender pursuant to its nomination of such branch or 
Affiliate, where the Lender or the relevant branch or Affiliate requests this in order 
to mitigate any legal obligation to deduct Tax from any payment to such branch or 
Affiliate or any payment obligation which might otherwise arise pursuant to 
Clause 18 (Taxes) or Clause 19 (Increased Costs); or
(ii)in any other circumstance, may be delivered to the Facility Office of the Lender, 
who will act as the representative of any Affiliate it nominates for all 
administrative purposes under this Agreement.
(f) If a Lender nominates an Affiliate, that Lender and that Affiliate:
(i)will be treated as having a single Commitment (being the Commitment of that 
Lender) but for all other purposes (other than those referred to in paragraphs (c)</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 90 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreementand (e)(i) above and sub-paragraph (ii) below) will be treated as separate Lenders; 
and
(ii)will be regarded as a single Lender for the purpose of:
(A) voting in relation to any matter in connection with a Finance Document; 
and
(B) compliance with Clause 29.2 (Assignments and Transfers by Lenders).
(g) The Obligors, the Agent, the Security Agent and the other Finance Parties will be entitled 
to deal only with the designating Lender, except all payments of principal, interest, fees, 
costs, Taxes and commissions in connection with a Designated Loan shall be for the 
account of the relevant Designated Affiliate. For the avoidance of doubt, this shall not apply 
to any commitment fee which shall be for the account of the relevant Lender.
(h) A Lender that has made a nomination in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (g) above may 
revoke such nomination in relation to any future Loans by giving the Agent at least five (5) 
Business Days' written notice.
(i) Upon such Designated Affiliate ceasing to be a Designated Affiliate, the Lender will 
automatically assume (and be deemed to assume without further action by any Party) all 
rights and obligations previously vested in the Designated Affiliate.
(j) This Clause 2.5 is without prejudice to a Lender's right to Transfer its Commitments to an 
Affiliate under Clause 29 (Changes to the Lenders).
2.6 Obligors' Agent
(a) To the extent permitted under any applicable law, each Obligor (other than the Obligors' 
Agent), by its execution of this Agreement or an Accession Deed, irrevocably (to the extent 
permitted by law) appoints the Obligors' Agent to act severally on its behalf as its agent in 
relation to the Finance Documents and irrevocably (to the extent permitted by law)

Documents, to agree to any Additional Facility terms, to deliver Additional 
Facility Notices, to make such agreements and to effect the relevant amendments, 
supplements and variations capable of being given, made or effected by any 
Obligor, notwithstanding that they may affect the Obligor, without further 
reference to or the consent of that Obligor; and
(ii)each Finance Party to give any notice, demand or other communication to that 
Obligor pursuant to the Finance Documents to the Obligors' Agent,
and in each case the Obligor shall be bound as though the Obligor itself had given the 
notices and instructions (including any Utilisation Requests and/or Selection Notices) or 
executed or made the agreements or effected the amendments, supplements or variations, 
or received the relevant notice, demand or other communication and each Finance Party 
may rely on any action taken by the Obligors' Agent on behalf of that Obligor.
(b) Every act, omission, agreement, undertaking, settlement, waiver, amendment, supplement, 
variation, notice or other communication given or made by the Obligors' Agent or given to 
the Obligors' Agent under any Finance Document on behalf of another Obligor or in</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 91 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreementconnection with any Finance Document (whether or not known to any other Obligor and 
whether occurring before or after such other Obligor became an Obligor under any Finance 
Document shall be binding for all purposes on that Obligor as if that Obligor had expressly 
made, given or concurred with it (to the extent permitted by law)). In the event of any 
conflict between any notices or other communications of the Obligors' Agent and any other 
Obligor, those of the Obligors' Agent shall prevail.
(c) For the purpose of this Clause 2.6, each Obligor (to the extent necessary under applicable 
law) shall grant a specific power of attorney (notarized and apostilled) to the Obligors' 
Agent and comply with any necessary formalities in connection therewith.

(such amount, the &quot;Notional Amount&quot; and the amount, if any, by which the Notional 
Amount exceeds the Base Currency Amount of such Letter of Credit, being the &quot;Excess 
Amount&quot;).
(b) If the Excess Amount in relation to a Letter of Credit is more than five (5) per cent. of the 
Base Currency Amount of that Letter of Credit, a Revolving Facility Borrower (or the 
Company on its behalf) shall, if so requested by the Agent or the relevant Issuing Bank, 
within twenty (20) Business Days of any calculation under paragraph (a) above, ensure that 
within five (5) Business Days sufficient Letters of Credit are prepaid, or Loans prepaid, to 
prevent:
(i)the Base Currency Amount of all Utilisations of the relevant Revolving Facility 
from exceeding the relevant Revolving Facility Commitments (after deducting the 
total Ancillary Commitments, Fronting Ancillary Commitments and Fronted 
Ancillary Commitments) following any adjustment to a Base Currency Amount 
under paragraph (a) above; and
(ii)the Base Currency Amount of all Bilateral Letters of Credit issued by that Issuing 
Bank and its L/C Proportion of any Fronted Letters of Credit, in each case under a 
Revolving Facility, from exceeding the Revolving Facility Commitments (after 
deducting the total Ancillary Commitments, Fronting Ancillary Commitments and 
Fronted Ancillary Commitments) held by that Issuing Bank as a Revolving Facility 
Lender under that Revolving Facility.
6.9 Reduction or expiry of Letter of Credit
If the amount of any Letter of Credit is wholly or partially reduced or it is repaid or prepaid or it 
expires prior to its Expiry Date, the relevant Issuing Bank and the Borrower that requested (or on</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 106 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreementbehalf of which the Company requested) the issue of that Letter of Credit shall promptly notify the

its behalf) on the Termination Date applicable to the relevant Revolving Facility, (or such earlier 
date in accordance with this Agreement), provided that if any Letter of Credit has an Expiry Date 
ending on or after the Termination Date applicable to the applicable Revolving Facility, without 
prejudice to the repayment obligation in Clause 6.8 ( Revaluation of Letters of Credit), on such 
Termination Date each such Letter of Credit shall be repaid unless, in the case of a Letter of Credit 
with an Expiry Date falling after such Termination Date:
(a) the relevant Issuing Bank agrees that such Letter of Credit shall continue as between that 
Issuing Bank, and the relevant member of the Group on a bilateral basis and not as part of 
or under the Finance Documents; and
(b) save for any rights and obligations against any other Finance Party under the Finance 
Documents arising prior to such Termination Date applicable to the relevant Revolving

Facility Lender in relation to such Letter of Credit shall be released on the Termination 
Date, and the Transaction Security shall not (following release thereof by the Security

Termination Date and, in such circumstances, from the Termination Date pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of Clause 7.3 ( Indemnities) and Clause 7.4 ( Cash collateral by Non-
Acceptable L/C Lender) shall not apply to any such Letter of Credit or to any claim made

(b) Each Borrower (or the Company on its behalf) shall promptly on receipt of any demand 
under paragraph (a) above pay to the relevant Issuing Bank an amount equal to the amount

(i)are not obliged to carry out any investigation or seek any confirmation from any 
other person before paying a claim (including any solvency investigation); and
(ii)deal in documents only and will not be concerned with the legality of a claim or

of any person.
(d) The obligations of a Borrower under this Clause 7 will not be affected by:
(i)the sufficiency, accuracy or genuineness of any claim or any other document; or
(ii)any incapacity of, or limitation on the powers of, any person signing a claim or 
other document.
7.3 Indemnities
(a) Each Borrower shall promptly on demand indemnify an Issuing Bank against any cost, loss 
or liability incurred by that Issuing Bank (otherwise than by reason of that Issuing Bank's</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 108 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreementgross negligence or wilful misconduct or breach of the terms of this Agreement) in acting 
as Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit requested by (or on behalf of) that Borrower.
(b) In relation to a Fronted Letter of Credit, each Revolving Facility Lender shall (according 
to its L/C Proportion) immediately on demand indemnify the Fronting Issuing Bank against 
any cost, loss or liability incurred by the Fronting Issuing Bank (otherwise than by reason 
of the Fronting Issuing Bank's gross negligence or wilful misconduct or breach of the terms 
of this Agreement) in acting as the Fronting Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit (unless 
the Fronting Issuing Bank has been reimbursed by an Obligor pursuant to a Finance 
Document).
(c) If any Revolving Facility Lender is not permitted (by its constitutional documents or any 
applicable law) to comply with paragraph (b) above, then that Revolving Facility Lender 
will not be obliged to comply with paragraph (b) and shall instead be deemed to have taken, 
on the date the Fronted Letter of Credit is issued (or, if later, on the date the Revolving 
Facility Lender's participation in the Fronted Letter of Credit is transferred to or assumed 
by the Revolving Facility Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), an 
undivided interest and participation in the Fronted Letter of Credit in an amount equal to 
its L/C Proportion of that Letter of Credit. On receipt of demand from the Agent, that 
Revolving Facility Lender shall pay to the Agent (for the account of the Fronting Issuing 
Bank) an amount equal to its L/C Proportion of the amount demanded.

breach of the terms of this Agreement in relation to such Letter of Credit by, such Lender.
(e) The obligations of each Revolving Facility Lender or Borrower under this Clause 7.3 are 
continuing obligations and will extend to the ultimate balance of sums payable by that 
Revolving Facility Lender or Borrower in respect of any Letter of Credit, regardless of any 
intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part.
(f) The obligations of any Revolving Facility Lender or Borrower under this Clause 7.3 will 
not be affected by any act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this Clause 7.3, would 
reduce, release or prejudice any of its obligations under this Clause 7.3 (whether or not 
known to it or any other person) including:
(i)any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any Obligor, any 
beneficiary under a Letter of Credit or any other person;
(ii)the release of any other Obligor or any other person under the terms of any 
composition or arrangement with any creditor or any member of the Group;
(iii)the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or release of, or refusal or 
neglect to perfect, take up or enforce, any rights against, or security over assets of, 
any Obligor, any beneficiary under a Letter of Credit or other person or any non-
presentation or non-observance of any formality or other requirement in respect of 
any instrument (other than the relevant Letter of Credit) or any failure to realise 
the full value of any security;
(iv)any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of or dissolution or 
change in the members or status of an Obligor, any beneficiary under a Letter of 
Credit or any other person;
(v)any amendment, novation, supplement, extension, restatement (however

by notice to that Revolving Facility Lender, request that Revolving Facility Lender to pay 
and that Revolving Facility Lender shall pay, on or prior to the date falling five (5) Business 
Days after the request by the relevant Fronting Issuing Bank, an amount equal to that 
Revolving Facility Lender's L/C Proportion of the outstanding amount of a Fronted Letter 
of Credit and in the currency of that Fronted Letter of Credit to an interest bearing account 
held in the name of that Revolving Facility Lender with the relevant Fronting Issuing Bank.
(b) The Non-Acceptable L/C Lender to whom a request has been made in accordance with

and payable under the Finance Documents by that Revolving Facility Lender to the 
Fronting Issuing Bank in respect of that Letter of Credit.

Letter of Credit, withdrawals from the account may only be made to pay to the Fronting 
Issuing Bank amounts due and payable to the applicable Issuing Bank by the Non-
Acceptable L/C Lender under the Finance Documents in respect of that Letter of Credit or 
as contemplated by Clause 6.11 ( Effect of Termination Date).
(d) Each Revolving Facility Lender shall notify the Agent:
(i)other than in the case of an Original Lender, on any date on which such Revolving 
Facility Lender becomes such a Lender in accordance with Clause 2.3 (Increase) 
or Clause 29 (Changes to the Lenders), whether it is a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender 
within paragraph (a) of the definition thereof; and
(ii)as soon as practicable upon becoming aware of the same, that it has become a Non-
Acceptable L/C Lender,
and as indicated in Part II ( The Original Lenders) of Schedule 1 ( The Original Parties), in 
a Transfer Certificate, in an Assignment Agreement or in an Increase Confirmation to that 
effect will constitute a notice under paragraph (d)(i) above to the Agent.
(e) Any notice received by the Agent pursuant to paragraph (d) above shall constitute notice to 
the Fronting Issuing Bank of that Revolving Facility Lender's status and the Agent shall, 
upon receiving each such notice, promptly notify the Fronting Issuing Banks of that 
Revolving Facility Lender's status as specified in that notice.
(f) If a Revolving Facility Lender who has provided cash collateral in accordance with this 
Clause 7.4:
(i)ceases to be a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender; and</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 110 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreement(ii)no amount is due and payable by that Revolving Facility Lender in respect of a 
Letter of Credit,
that Revolving Facility Lender may, at any time it is not a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender, by 
notice to the relevant Fronting Issuing Bank request that an amount equal to the amount of 
the cash provided by it as collateral in respect of that Fronted Letter of Credit (together with 
any accrued interest) standing to the credit of the relevant account held with the relevant 
Fronting Issuing Bank be returned to it and the Fronting Issuing Bank shall pay that amount 
to the Revolving Facility Lender within five (5) Business Days after the request from the 
Revolving Facility Lender (and shall cooperate with the Revolving Facility Lender in order 
to procure that the relevant security or collateral arrangement is released and discharged).
7.5 Cash cover by Borrower
(a) If a Revolving Facility Lender which is a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender fails to provide cash 
collateral (or notifies the Fronting Issuing Bank or Agent that it will not provide cash 
collateral) in accordance with Clause 7.4 (Cash collateral by Non-Acceptable L/C Lender) 
and the Fronting Issuing Bank notifies the Company of such event (with a copy to the 
Agent), the Borrower of the relevant Fronted Letter of Credit or proposed Fronted Letter 
of Credit may (in the case of a Fronted Letter of Credit not yet issued) elect to or (in the 
case of a Fronted Letter of Credit that has already been issued) shall provide cash cover to 
an account with the Fronting Issuing Bank in an amount equal to that Revolving Facility 
Lender's L/C Proportion of the outstanding amount of that Fronted Letter of Credit and in 
the currency of that Fronted Letter of Credit and that Borrower shall do so within five (5) 
Business Days (or such longer date as is agreed with the Fronting Issuing Bank (acting 
reasonably)) after the notice is given.
(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (f) of Clause 1.2 (Construction), the relevant Fronting Issuing 
Bank shall permit the withdrawal of amounts up to the level of that cash cover from the 
account if:
(i)it is satisfied that the relevant Revolving Facility Lender is no longer a Non-
Acceptable L/C Lender; or
(ii)the relevant Revolving Facility Lender's obligations in respect of the relevant 
Fronted Letter of Credit are transferred to a New Lender in accordance with the 
terms of this Agreement; or
(iii)an Increase Lender has agreed to undertake the obligations in respect of the 
relevant Revolving Facility Lender's L/C Proportion of the Fronted Letter of 
Credit.
(c) To the extent that a Borrower has provided cash cover in accordance with this Clause 7.5, 
the relevant Revolving Facility Lender's L/C Proportion in respect of that Fronted Letter of 
Credit will remain (but that Revolving Facility Lender's obligations in relation to that 
Fronted Letter of Credit may be satisfied in accordance with paragraph (f)(ii) of Clause 1.2 
(Construction)). However, the relevant Borrower's obligation to pay any Fronted Letter of 
Credit fee in relation to the relevant Fronted Letter of Credit to the Agent (for the account 
of that Revolving Facility Lender) in accordance with paragraph (b) of Clause 17.6 ( Fees 
payable in respect of Letters of Credit) will be reduced proportionately as from the date on 
which it complies with that obligation to provide cash cover (and for so long as the relevant 
amount of cash cover continues to stand as collateral).
(d) The relevant Fronting Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Agent of the extent to which 
a Borrower provides cash cover pursuant to this Clause 7.5 and of any change in the amount 
of cash cover so provided.</p>

entity in those capacities and capable, as a Lender, of contracting with itself as a Fronting Issuing 
Bank.
7.8 Existing Letters of Credit
(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, a Borrower (or the 
Company on its behalf) may by notice in writing to the Agent prior to the Closing Date 
(including in any Utilisation Request) request that any Existing Letter of Credit issued by 
an Issuing Bank be deemed a Letter of Credit issued and established under a Revolving 
Facility and with effect from the date specified in such notice (being a date falling within 
the Availability Period of the relevant Revolving Facility) that any such Existing Letter of 
Credit shall be a Letter of Credit for all purposes under this Agreement, subject to the Agent 
having received notification in writing from the relevant Issuing Bank that it agrees to the 
Existing Letter of Credit being a Letter of Credit for all purposes under this Agreement.
(b) For the purpose of this Clause 7.8, &quot;Existing Letter of Credit&quot; means any letter of credit, 
bank guarantee, other instrument falling within the definition of Letter of Credit or similar

(a)(iii) of Clause 4.3 ( Conditions relating to Optional Currencies) is not readily 
available to it in the amount required; or
(ii)a Lender notifies the Agent that compliance with its obligation to participate in a 
Loan in an Optional Currency requested under paragraph (a)(iii) of Clause 4.3 
(Conditions relating to Optional Currencies) would contravene a law or regulation 
applicable to it,
the Agent will give notice to the relevant Borrower (or the Company on its behalf) to that 
effect by the Specified Time. In this event, any Lender that gives notice pursuant to this 
Clause 8.2 will be required to participate in the Loan in the Base Currency (in an amount 
equal to that Lender's proportion of the Base Currency Amount, or in respect of a Rollover 
Loan, an amount equal to that Lender's proportion of the Base Currency Amount of the</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 112 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties AgreementRollover Loan that is due to be made) and its participation will be treated as a separate Loan 
denominated in the Base Currency during that Interest Period.
(b) Any part of a Loan treated as a separate Loan pursuant to this Clause 8.2 shall not be taken 
into account for the purposes of calculating any limit on the number of Loans or currencies

Lender or Fronting Ancillary Lender (as the case may be) unless such amendment or waiver 
itself relates to or gives rise to a matter which would require an amendment of or under this</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 114 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties AgreementAgreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, under this Clause 9). In such a case, the

Fronted Ancillary Lender; and
(ii)the Ancillary Facility or the Fronted Ancillary Facility (as the case may be) will 
be available,
with effect from the date agreed by the Company and the Ancillary Lender.
9.3 Terms of Ancillary Facilities and Fronted Ancillary Facilities
(a) Except as provided below and subject to this Clause 9, the terms of any Ancillary Facility 
or Fronted Ancillary Facility (as the case may be) will be those agreed by the Ancillary 
Lender or the Fronting Ancillary Lender (as the case may be) and the Company or relevant 
Borrower.
(b) However, those terms:
(i)to the extent relating to the rate of interest, fees and other remuneration in respect 
of that Ancillary Facility or Fronted Ancillary Facility, must be based upon the 
normal market rates and terms at that time (except as varied by this Agreement);
(ii)may only allow Revolving Facility Borrowers (or Affiliates of Revolving Facility 
Borrowers nominated pursuant to Clause 9.9 (Affiliates of Borrowers)) to use that 
Ancillary Facility or Fronted Ancillary Facility (as the case may be);

Termination Date applicable to the relevant Revolving Facility.
(c) If there is any inconsistency between any term of an Ancillary Facility or Fronted Ancillary 
Facility and any term of this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail except for (i) Clause 
38.3 ( Day count convention) which shall not prevail for the purposes of calculating fees, 
interest or commission relating to an Ancillary Facility or Fronted Ancillary Facility, (ii) 
an Ancillary Facility or Fronted Ancillary Facility comprising more than one account where 
the terms of the Ancillary Documents shall prevail to the extent necessary to permit the

Document, in which case that term of this Agreement shall not prevail.
(d) Interest, commission and fees on Ancillary Facilities are dealt with in Clause 17.7 ( Interest, 
commission and fees on Ancillary Facilities and Fronted Ancillary Facilities).
9.4 Repayment of Ancillary Facility or Fronted Ancillary Facility

and Fronted Ancillary Facilities), an Ancillary Facility or a Fronted Ancillary Facility (as 
the case may be) shall cease to be available on the Termination Date in relation to the 
relevant Revolving Facility or, for the avoidance of doubt, such earlier date on which its 
Expiry Date occurs or on which it is cancelled in accordance with the terms of the relevant 
Ancillary Facility or Fronted Ancillary Facility (as the case may be).
(b) Subject to paragraph (c) below, if and to the extent an Ancillary Facility or a Fronted 
Ancillary Facility (as the case may be) expires or is otherwise cancelled (in whole or in 
part) in accordance with its terms or is otherwise cancelled in accordance with this 
Agreement, the Ancillary Commitment or Fronting Ancillary Commitment and Fronted 
Ancillary Commitments of the Ancillary Lender or the Fronting Ancillary Lender and 
Fronted Ancillary Lenders (as the case may be) shall be reduced to zero (0) (or by such 
amount that expires or has been cancelled) (and the relevant Revolving Facility 
Commitment of that Ancillary Lender or Fronting Ancillary Lender and the Fronted 
Ancillary Lenders (as the case may be) shall immediately be increased accordingly by the 
same amount).
(c) No Ancillary Lender, Fronting Ancillary Lender or Fronted Ancillary Lender may demand 
repayment or prepayment of, or cash cover for, any Ancillary Outstandings prior to the 
scheduled final Expiry Date of the relevant Ancillary Facility or Fronted Ancillary Facility 
(as the case may be), or otherwise take any action (without the consent of the Company) to 
terminate prior to its scheduled final Expiry Date any Ancillary Facility or Fronted 
Ancillary Facility (as the case may be) unless it is permitted to do so under the relevant 
Ancillary Documents and if it gives the Company and the relevant Borrower not less than 
five (5) Business Days' notice and (unless otherwise agreed by the relevant Borrower) 
unless:
(i)required to reduce the Gross Outstandings of an Ancillary Facility provided by 
way of a multi-account overdraft to or towards an amount equal to its Net 
Outstandings;
(ii)the relevant Total Revolving Facility Commitments have been cancelled in full, or 
all outstanding Utilisations under the relevant Revolving Facility have become or 
have been declared due and payable in accordance with the terms of this 
Agreement or the Expiry Date of the Ancillary Facility or Fronted Ancillary 
Facility occurs;</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 116 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreement(iii)it becomes unlawful in any applicable jurisdiction for the Ancillary Lender or 
Fronting Ancillary Lender to perform any of its obligations as contemplated by 
this Agreement or to fund, issue or maintain its participation in its Ancillary 
Facility or Fronted Ancillary Facility (or it becomes unlawful for any Affiliate of 
the Ancillary Lender, Fronting Ancillary Lender or Fronted Ancillary Lender (as 
applicable) to do so); or
(iv)the Ancillary Outstandings (if any) under that Ancillary Facility or Fronted 
Ancillary Facility (as the case may be) can be refinanced in full by a Revolving 
Facility Utilisation under the relevant Revolving Facility pursuant to which that 
Ancillary Outstanding was incurred and the Ancillary Lender or Fronting 
Ancillary Lender gives sufficient notice to enable such a Revolving Facility 
Utilisation to be made to refinance those Ancillary Outstandings.
(d) For the purposes of determining whether or not the Ancillary Outstandings under an 
Ancillary Facility or Fronted Ancillary Facility (as the case may be) mentioned in 
paragraph (c)(iv) above or in Clause 9.6 (Voluntary cancellation of Ancillary Facilities and 
Fronted Ancillary Facilities) can be refinanced by a Utilisation under the Revolving 
Facility pursuant to which that Ancillary Outstanding was incurred:
(i)the relevant Revolving Facility Commitment of the Ancillary Lender will be 
increased by the amount of its Ancillary Commitment, Fronted Ancillary 
Commitment or Fronting Ancillary Commitment (as the case may be); and
(ii)the Utilisation may (so long as paragraph (c)(i) above does not apply) be made 
irrespective of whether a Default is outstanding or any applicable condition 
precedent is not satisfied (but only to the extent that the proceeds are applied in 
refinancing those Ancillary Outstandings) and irrespective of whether Clause 4.4 
(Maximum number of Utilisations) or paragraph (a)(iv) of Clause 5.2 (Completion 
of a Utilisation Request for Loans) applies.
(e) On the making of a Utilisation of a Revolving Facility to refinance all or part of any 
Ancillary Outstandings under the same Revolving Facility:
(i)each Revolving Facility Lender will participate in that Utilisation in an amount (as 
determined by the Agent) which will result as nearly as possible in the aggregate 
amount of its participation in the relevant Revolving Facility Utilisations then 
outstanding bearing the same proportion to the aggregate amount of the relevant 
Revolving Facility Utilisations then outstanding as its relevant Revolving Facility 
Commitment bears to the relevant Total Revolving Facility Commitments; and
(ii)the relevant Ancillary Facility or Fronted Ancillary Facility shall be cancelled to 
the extent of such refinancing.
(f) In relation to an Ancillary Facility or Fronted Ancillary Facility which comprises an 
overdraft facility where a Designated Net Amount has been established, the Ancillary 
Lender or Fronting Ancillary Lender providing that Ancillary Facility or Fronted Ancillary 
Lender shall only be obliged to take into account for the purposes of calculating compliance 
with the Designated Net Amount those credit balances which it is permitted to take into 
account by the then current law and regulations in relation to its reporting of exposures to 
the applicable regulatory authorities as netted for capital adequacy purposes.
9.5 Ancillary Outstandings
Each Borrower and each Ancillary Lender agrees with and for the benefit of each Lender that:</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 117 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreement(a) the Ancillary Outstandings under any Ancillary Facility or Fronted Ancillary Facility shall 
not exceed the Ancillary Commitment or aggregate of the relevant Fronting Ancillary 
Commitment and Fronted Ancillary Commitments (as the case may be) applicable to that 
Ancillary Facility or Fronted Ancillary Facility; and
(b) in relation to an overdraft facility comprising more than one account:
(i)such Ancillary Outstandings shall not exceed the Designated Net Amount 
applicable to that overdraft; and
(ii)the Gross Outstandings shall not exceed the Designated Gross Amount applicable 
to that overdraft.
9.6 Voluntary cancellation of Ancillary Facilities and Fronted Ancillary Facilities
The Company may at any time by written notice to the Agent or each applicable Ancillary Lender 
and/or Fronting Ancillary Lender:
(a) immediately cancel the whole or any part of an undrawn Ancillary Facility or Fronted 
Ancillary Facility; or
(b) by not less than one (1) Business Day's notice (or such shorter period as the Agent or each 
applicable Ancillary Lender and/or Fronting Ancillary Lender may agree) prepay the whole 
or any part of a drawn Ancillary Facility or Fronted Ancillary Facility, whether by 
refinancing by a Utilisation under the relevant Revolving Facility in accordance with 
paragraph (d) of Clause 9.4 (Repayment of Ancillary Facility or Fronted Ancillary Facility) 
or otherwise,
in which event on the date specified in the notice, the respective Ancillary Commitment or Fronting 
Ancillary Commitment and Fronted Ancillary Commitments of the relevant Ancillary Lender or 
Fronting Ancillary Lender and Fronted Ancillary Lenders shall be cancelled or prepaid and 
cancelled (as applicable) in the amount specified and, in each case, immediately converted into a 
relevant Revolving Facility Commitment. In the case of (i) any partial cancellation of a Fronted 
Ancillary Facility, the Fronting Ancillary Commitment of the Fronting Ancillary Lender and the 
Fronted Ancillary Commitments of the Fronted Ancillary Lenders shall be reduced rateably; and 
(ii) any partial prepayment of a Fronted Ancillary Facility, the Fronting Ancillary Lender and 
Fronted Ancillary Lenders shall be prepaid pro rata their Fronting Ancillary Commitment or 
Fronted Ancillary Commitments (as applicable).
9.7 Information
Each Borrower, each Ancillary Lender, each Fronting Ancillary Lender and each Fronted Ancillary 
Lender shall, promptly upon request by the Agent, supply the Agent with any information relating 
to the operation of an Ancillary Facility or Fronted Ancillary Facility (including the Ancillary 
Outstandings) as the Agent may reasonably request from time to time. Each Borrower consents to 
all such information being released to the Agent and the other Finance Parties.
9.8 Affiliates of Lenders
(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, an Affiliate of a Revolving Facility Lender may 
become an Ancillary Lender, a Fronted Ancillary Lender or a Fronting Ancillary Lender 
(as the case may be). In such case, other than for the purpose of any clause referring to Tax 
(including, Clause 41.5 ( Replacement of a Lender), Clause 18 (Taxes) and Clause 21 
(Mitigation by the Lenders)) to the extent such clauses expressly deal with Tax matters, the 
Revolving Facility Lender and its Affiliate shall be treated as a single Revolving Facility 
Lender whose Revolving Facility Commitment is the amount of such Revolving Facility 
Lender's Revolving Facility Commitment under the relevant Revolving Facility. For the</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 118 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreementpurposes of calculating the Revolving Facility Lender's Available Commitment with 
respect to the relevant Revolving Facility, the Revolving Facility Lender's Commitment 
under the relevant Revolving Facility shall be reduced to the extent of the aggregate of the 
Ancillary Commitments, Fronting Ancillary Commitments and Fronted Ancillary 
Commitments of its Affiliates.
(b) The relevant Borrower (or the Company on its behalf) shall specify any relevant Affiliate 
of a Revolving Facility Lender in any notice delivered by it to the Agent pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of Clause 9.2 (Availability).
(c) An Affiliate of a Revolving Facility Lender which becomes an Ancillary Lender, a Fronted 
Ancillary Lender or Fronting Ancillary Lender shall accede to the Intercreditor Agreement 
and any person who so accedes to the Intercreditor Agreement shall, at the same time, 
become a Party as an Ancillary Lender, a Fronted Ancillary Lender or Fronting Ancillary 
Lender (as applicable) in accordance with clause 21.9 (Creditor/Agent Accession 
Undertaking) of the Intercreditor Agreement.
(d) If a Revolving Facility Lender assigns all of its rights and benefits or transfers all of its 
rights and obligations to a New Lender (as defined in Clause 29 (Changes to the Lenders)), 
its Affiliate shall cease to have any obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary 
Document.
(e) Where this Agreement or any other Finance Document imposes an obligation on an 
Ancillary Lender, Fronted Ancillary Lender or Fronting Ancillary Lender and the relevant 
Ancillary Lender, Fronted Ancillary Lender or Fronting Ancillary Lender is an Affiliate of 
a Revolving Facility Lender which is not a party to that document, the relevant Revolving 
Facility Lender shall ensure that the obligation is performed by its Affiliate.
9.9 Affiliates of Borrowers
(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, a member of the Group which is an Affiliate of a 
Revolving Facility Borrower may with the approval of the relevant Ancillary Lender or 
Fronting Ancillary Lender become a borrower with respect to an Ancillary Facility or a 
Fronted Ancillary Facility (as the case may be).
(b) The relevant Borrower (or the Company on its behalf) shall specify any relevant Affiliate 
of a Revolving Facility Borrower in any notice delivered by the Company to the Agent 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of Clause 9.2 (Availability).
(c) If a Borrower ceases to be a Revolving Facility Borrower under this Agreement in 
accordance with Clause 31.4 ( Resignation of an Obligor), its Affiliate shall cease to have 
any rights under this Agreement or any Ancillary Document (unless such Affiliate is also 
an Affiliate of another Revolving Facility Borrower). If an Affiliate of a Revolving Facility 
Borrower ceases to be an Affiliate of such Revolving Facility Borrower (unless such 
Affiliate is also an Affiliate of another Revolving Facility Borrower), it shall cease to have 
any rights under this Agreement or any Ancillary Document.
(d) Where this Agreement or any other Finance Document imposes an obligation on a 
Borrower under an Ancillary Facility or a Fronted Ancillary Facility (as the case may be) 
and the relevant Borrower is an Affiliate of a Borrower which is not a party to that 
document, the relevant Borrower shall ensure that the obligation is performed by its 
Affiliate.
(e) Any reference in this Agreement or any other Finance Document to a Borrower being under 
no obligations (whether actual or contingent) as a Borrower under such Finance Document 
shall be construed to include a reference to any Affiliate of a Borrower being under no 
obligations under any Finance Document or Ancillary Document.</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 119 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreement9.10 Revolving Facility Commitment Amounts
Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement, each Revolving Facility Lender shall ensure that 
at all times its Revolving Facility Commitment (ignoring for this purpose any reduction in its 
Revolving Facility Commitment arising out of such Revolving Facility Lender providing an 
Ancillary Facility or a Fronted Ancillary Facility pursuant to this Clause 9) is not less than the 
aggregate of:
(a) its Ancillary Commitment and its Fronting Ancillary Commitment and its Fronted 
Ancillary Commitment (if any); and
(b) the Ancillary Commitment and Fronting Ancillary Commitment and Fronted Ancillary 
Commitment of its Affiliates (if any),
in each case, under the applicable Revolving Facility.
9.11 Adjustments required in relation to Ancillary Facilities
The Agent may (and shall at the request of the Company), by notice in writing to the relevant 
Revolving Facility Lenders, reallocate drawn and undrawn Revolving Facility Commitments at the 
end of an Interest Period among relevant Revolving Facility Lenders as may be necessary to ensure 
that any relevant Revolving Facility Lender that intends to enter into an Ancillary Facility has an 
undrawn Commitment under the relevant Revolving Facility sufficient to allow it to enter into such 
Ancillary Facility, provided that for the avoidance of doubt no such reallocation may increase any 
Revolving Facility Lender's Revolving Facility Commitment.
9.12 Adjustment for Ancillary Facilities upon acceleration
(a) If a Declared Default or Declared RCF Default  occurs, each Revolving Facility Lender, 
each Ancillary Lender and each Fronting Ancillary Lender or Fronted Ancillary Lender 
shall promptly adjust (by making or receiving (as the case may be) corresponding transfers 
of rights and obligations under the Finance Documents relating to Revolving Outstandings) 
their claims in respect of amounts outstanding to them under the relevant Revolving 
Facility, each Ancillary Facility and each Fronted Ancillary Facility to the extent necessary 
to ensure that after such transfers the Revolving Outstandings of each Revolving Facility 
Lender bear the same proportion to the relevant Total Revolving Outstandings as such 
Revolving Facility Lender's relevant Revolving Facility Commitment bears to the relevant 
Total Revolving Facility Commitments, each as at the date the notice of such Declared 
Default or Declared RCF Default is served under Clause 28.6 ( Acceleration).
(b) If an amount outstanding under an Ancillary Facility or Fronted Ancillary Facility is a 
contingent liability and that contingent liability becomes an actual liability or is reduced to 
zero (0) after the original adjustment is made under paragraph (a) above, then each 
Revolving Facility Lender and Ancillary Lender or Fronted Ancillary Lender or Fronting 
Ancillary Lender (as the case may be) will make a further adjustment (by making or 
receiving (as the case may be) corresponding transfers of rights and obligations under the 
Finance Documents relating to Revolving Outstandings to the extent necessary) to put 
themselves in the position they would have been in had the original adjustment been 
determined by reference to the actual liability or, as the case may be, zero (0) liability and 
not the contingent liability.
(c) Prior to the application of the provisions of paragraph (a) above, an Ancillary Lender or 
Fronting Ancillary Lender that has provided an overdraft comprising more than one account 
under an Ancillary Facility or Fronted Ancillary Facility shall set-off any liabilities owing 
to it under such overdraft facility against credit balances on any account comprised in such 
overdraft facility.</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 120 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreement(d) All calculations to be made pursuant to this Clause 9.12 shall be made by the Agent based 
upon information provided to it by the Revolving Facility Lenders, Ancillary Lenders, 
Fronted Ancillary Lenders or Fronting Ancillary Lenders.
(e) In this Clause 9.12:
&quot;Revolving Outstandings&quot; means, in relation to a Revolving Facility Lender, the 
aggregate of the equivalent in the Base Currency of (i) its participation in each Revolving 
Facility Utilisation then outstanding under a particular Revolving Facility (together with 
the aggregate amount of all accrued interest, fees and commission owed to it as a Revolving 
Facility Lender under such Revolving Facility), and (ii) if the Revolving Facility Lender is 
also an Ancillary Lender or Fronted Ancillary Lender or Fronting Ancillary Lender (as the 
case may be), the Ancillary Outstandings in respect of the Ancillary Facilities or the 
Fronted Ancillary Facilities, attributable to that Ancillary Lender (or its Affiliate) or to its 
Fronting Ancillary Commitment or Fronting Ancillary Commitment (together with the 
aggregate amount of all accrued interest, fees and commission owed (or attributable) to it 
or to its Affiliate in such capacity).
&quot;Total Revolving Outstandings&quot; means the aggregate of all Revolving Outstandings.
9.13 Existing Ancillary Facilities
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, a Borrower (or the Company on 
its behalf) may by notice in writing to the Agent on or prior to the Closing Date (including in any 
Utilisation Request) request that any Approved Existing Ancillary Facility made available by a 
Revolving Facility Lender be deemed to be an Ancillary Facility established under a Revolving 
Facility (and in place of corresponding commitments of that Revolving Facility Lender) and with 
effect from the date specified in such notice or any date subsequently notified to the Agent (being a 
date falling within the Availability Period for the relevant Revolving Facility) that Approved 
Existing Ancillary Facility shall be an Ancillary Facility for all purposes under this Agreement, 
subject to the Agent having received notification in writing from the Ancillary Lender concerned 
(or, as the case may be, the Affiliate of the Revolving Facility Lender concerned) that it agrees to 
that Approved Existing Ancillary Facility being an Ancillary Facility for all purposes under this 
Agreement.
9.14 Ancillary Facility Implementation
In order to facilitate the implementation of an Ancillary Facility, notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary in this Agreement and for the purposes of paragraph (b) of Clause 5.4 ( Lenders' 
participation) and paragraph (f) of Clause 6.5 ( Issue of Letters of Credit) only, from the date that 
the Agent is notified of the establishment of the relevant Ancillary Facility until the date of 
establishment of such Ancillary Facility in accordance with paragraph (b) of Clause 9.2 
(Availability), the Available Commitment of such Ancillary Lender concerned (or, as the case may 
be, the Affiliate of the Revolving Facility Lender concerned) under the relevant Revolving Facility 
shall be deemed to be reduced by the amount of the relevant Ancillary Facility being established 
(or, if no such amount has been notified, deemed to be reduced to zero (0)) such that the Ancillary 
Lender concerned (or, as the case may be, the Affiliate of the Revolving Facility Lender concerned) 
shall not (and shall not be required to) participate in any Revolving Facility Utilisation to be made 
on or prior to such date of establishment (or any subsequent Rollover Loan in respect thereof) to the 
extent of such reduction.
9.15 Continuation of Ancillary Facilities and Fronted Ancillary Facilities
(a) Each Ancillary Facility and Fronted Ancillary Facility shall be prepaid and cancelled on 
the Termination Date applicable to the relevant Revolving Facility (or such earlier date in 
accordance with this Agreement), provided that a Borrower and an Ancillary Lender or 
Fronting Ancillary Lender and/or Fronted Ancillary Lender (as the case may be) may, as</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 121 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreementbetween themselves only, agree that any Ancillary Facilities or Fronted Ancillary Facilities 
will continue to remain available on a bilateral basis following the Termination Date 
applicable to the relevant Revolving Facility or, as the case may be, the date the relevant 
Revolving Facility Commitments are otherwise cancelled under this Agreement.
(b) If any arrangement contemplated in paragraph (a) above is to occur, each relevant Borrower 
and the Ancillary Lender, Fronted Ancillary Lender or, as the case may be, the Fronting 
Ancillary Lender shall each confirm that to be the case in writing to the Agent. Upon such 
Termination Date or, as the case may be, date of cancellation, any such facility shall 
continue as between the said entities on a bilateral basis and not as part of, or under, the 
Finance Documents. Save for any rights and obligations against any Finance Party under 
the Finance Documents arising prior to such Termination Date or, as the case may be, date 
of cancellation, no such rights or obligations in respect of such Ancillary Facility or, as the 
case may be, Fronted Ancillary Facility shall, as between the Finance Parties (including in 
their capacity as Fronting Ancillary Lenders), continue and the Transaction Security shall 
not support any such facility in respect of any matters that arise after such Termination Date 
or, as the case may be, date of cancellation.
9.16 Fronted Ancillary Commitment Indemnities
(a) A Borrower must, promptly on demand, indemnify each Fronting Ancillary Lender against 
any loss or liability which that Fronting Ancillary Lender incurs in acting as the Fronting 
Ancillary Lender under any Fronted Ancillary Facility requested by it (or any of its 
Affiliates), except to the extent that the loss or liability is caused by the gross negligence 
or wilful misconduct of, or breach of the terms of the Finance Documents by, that Fronting 
Ancillary Lender.
(b) Each Fronted Ancillary Lender must promptly on demand indemnify the Fronting Ancillary 
Lender (according to its Fronted Ancillary Portion) against any loss or liability which the 
Fronting Ancillary Lender incurs in acting as the Fronting Ancillary Lender under any 
Fronted Ancillary Facility and which at the date of demand has not been paid for by an 
Obligor, except to the extent that the loss or liability is caused by the gross negligence or 
wilful misconduct of, or breach of the terms of any Finance Document by, the Fronting 
Ancillary Lender.
(c) The relevant Borrower which requested for itself or for one of its Affiliates (or on behalf 
of which the Company requested) the Fronted Ancillary Facility must, promptly on 
demand, reimburse any Fronted Ancillary Lender for any payment it makes to the Fronting 
Ancillary Lender under paragraph (b) above except to the extent arising out of the gross 
negligence or wilful misconduct of, or breach of the terms of any Finance Document by, 
such Fronted Ancillary Lender.
(d) The obligations of each Borrower and each Fronted Ancillary Lender under this Clause 
9.16 are continuing obligations and will extend to the ultimate balance of all sums payable 
by that Borrower or Fronted Ancillary Lender in respect of any Fronted Ancillary Facility, 
regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part.
(e) The obligations of any Fronted Ancillary Lender or Borrower under this Clause 9.16 will 
not be affected by any act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this Clause 9.16, would 
reduce, release or prejudice any of its obligations under this Clause 9.16 (whether or not 
known to it or any other person) including:
(i)any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with any Obligor, or any 
other person;
(ii)the release of any Obligor or any other person under the terms of any composition 
or arrangement with any creditor of any member of the Group;</p>

(iv)any non-presentation or non-observance of any formality or other requirement in 
respect of any instrument or any failure to realise the full value of any security;
(v)any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of or dissolution or

of a Fronted Ancillary Facility or any instrument issued thereunder, the relevant 
Borrower (or the Company on its behalf) and/or Fronting Ancillary Lender had not 
provided their consent to such amendment(s);
(vii)any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity of any obligation of any person under 
any Finance Document or any other document or security; or
(viii)any insolvency or similar proceedings.

Lender shall be conditional upon no security or payment to the Fronting Ancillary Lender 
by a Fronted Ancillary Lender or any other person on behalf of the Fronted Ancillary 
Lender being avoided or reduced by virtue of any laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, 
liquidation or similar laws of general application and, if any such security or payment is so 
avoided or reduced, the Fronting Ancillary Lender shall be entitled to recover the value or 
amount of such security or payment from such Fronted Ancillary Lender subsequently as

Revolving Facility Loans are to be made available to a Revolving Facility Borrower:
(i)on the same day one or more maturing Revolving Facility Loan(s) are due to be 
repaid by that Revolving Facility Borrower;
(ii)in the same currency as the maturing Revolving Facility Loan(s) (unless such 
Revolving Facility Loan arose as a result of the operation of Clause 8.2 
(Unavailability of a currency)); and
(iii)in whole or in part for the purpose of refinancing the maturing Revolving Facility 
Loan(s),
the aggregate amount of the new Revolving Facility Loan(s) shall, unless the relevant 
Borrower or the Company notifies the Agent to the contrary in the relevant Utilisation 
Request, be treated as if applied in or towards repayment of the maturing Revolving Facility 
Loan(s) so that:</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 124 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreement(A) if the aggregate amount of the maturing Revolving Facility Loan(s) 
exceeds the aggregate amount of the new Revolving Facility Loan(s), the 
relevant Borrower will only be required to make a payment under Clause 
35.1 ( Payments to the Agent) in an amount in the relevant currency equal 
to that excess;
(B) if the aggregate amount of the maturing Revolving Facility Loan(s) is 
equal to or less than the aggregate amount of the new Revolving Facility 
Loan(s), the relevant Borrower will not be required to make a payment 
under Clause 35.1 ( Payments to the Agent);
(C) to the extent that a Lender's participation (if any) in the maturing

(c) If any Revolving Facility Loan is not repaid on the last day of its Interest Period (the 
&quot;Maturing Revolving Facility Loan&quot;) and the applicable Borrower (or the Company on 
its behalf) has not notified the Agent that it intends to repay the Maturing Revolving Facility 
Loan on the last day of its Interest Period, a Rollover Loan (with an Interest Period 
corresponding to the Maturing Revolving Facility Loan) shall be deemed to have been 
drawn on the last day of the Interest Period for, and applied in repayment of, the Maturing 
Revolving Facility Loan.
10.4 Loans provided by a Defaulting Lender
(a) At any time when a Revolving Facility Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, the maturity 
date of each of the participations of that Lender in the Revolving Facility Loans then 
outstanding will be automatically extended to the Termination Date in relation to the 
relevant Revolving Facility and will be treated as separate Revolving Facility Loans (the 
&quot;Separate Loans&quot;) denominated in the currency in which the relevant participations are 
outstanding.
(b) A Borrower to whom a Separate Loan is outstanding may prepay all or part of that Separate 
Loan by giving not less than one (1) Business Day's notice to the Agent (or such shorter 
time period as agreed between the Borrower and the Agent) prior notice to the Agent. The</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 125 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties AgreementAgent will forward a copy of a prepayment notice received in accordance with this 
paragraph (b) to the Defaulting Lender concerned as soon as practicable on receipt.

to apply to Separate Loans other than to the extent inconsistent with paragraphs (a) to (c) 
above, in which case those paragraphs shall prevail in respect of any Separate Loan.
10.5 Effect of Cancellation and Prepayment on Scheduled Repayments
(a) If the Company cancels the whole or any part of a Commitment under an Amortising 
Facility in accordance with Clause 41.5 ( Replacement of a Lender) or if the Commitment 
under an Amortising Facility of any Lender is reduced under Clause 11.1 ( Illegality) then 
(other than, in any relevant case, to the extent that any part of the relevant Commitment(s) 
under the relevant Amortising Facility is subsequently increased pursuant to Clause 2.3 
(Increase)) the amount of the Amortising Facility Repayment Instalment for the relevant 
Amortising Facility for each Amortising Facility Repayment Date falling after that 
prepayment will reduce pro rata by the amount of the Commitment under the relevant 
Amortising Facility cancelled.
(b) If the Company cancels the whole or any part of a Commitment under an Amortising 
Facility in accordance with Clause 11.3 ( Voluntary cancellation) then the amount of the 
Amortising Facility Repayment Instalment for the relevant Amortising Facility for each 
Amortising Facility Repayment Date falling after that cancellation will reduce pro rata by 
the amount cancelled.
(c) If any of the Amortising Facility Loans are prepaid in accordance with Clause 41.5 
(Replacement of a Lender) or Clause 11.1 ( Illegality) then the amount of the Amortising 
Facility Repayment Instalment for the relevant Amortising Facility for each Amortising 
Facility Repayment Date falling after that prepayment will reduce pro rata by the amount 
of the Amortising Facility Loan prepaid.
(d) For any prepayment of any of the Amortising Facility Loans other than as contemplated by 
paragraph (c) above, the relevant Amortising Facility for each Amortising Facility 
Repayment Date falling after that prepayment will reduce in accordance with the allocation 
of such prepaid amounts against the Amortising Facility Repayment Instalments as notified 
by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion.

(v)making any other Restricted Payment or similar transaction,

Clause 10.6 ( Pre-Funding Loans before a Completion Date), provided that the relevant 
Completion Date has not occurred and no Loans are outstanding at such time (an &quot;Equity 
Withdrawal&quot;), and, for the avoidance of doubt, an Equity Withdrawal shall not constitute 
a breach of any provision of the Finance Documents.
(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including Clause 10.1 
(Repayment of Facility B Loans), Clause 13.3 ( No reborrowing of Term Facilities) and 
Clause 13.8 ( Effect of Repayment and Prepayment on Commitments)), if any part of Facility

(i)no Lender's Commitment under Facility B shall be reduced or cancelled by the 
amount repaid; and
(ii)each Lender's Facility B Commitment shall remain available for borrowing and/or 
reborrowing, as applicable, on one occasion only in accordance with the terms of

to the Acquisition Closing Date, it may be reborrowed in accordance with Clause 13.4 
(Reborrowing of Revolving Facility), provided that, prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, 
a reborrowing of the Original Revolving Facility may only occur if a Facility B Loan is (or 
will, on the proposed Utilisation Date, be) outstanding.

In respect of any Facility B (USD) Loans borrowed by the  Company and US Holdco (and if 
applicable, any Additional Borrower of Facility B (USD) as contemplated by Clause 31.2

five (5) Business Days prior to such settlement date), be cancelled 
and such Lender shall have no obligation to fund or participate in 
any new Utilisation or utilisation of an Ancillary Facility or 
Fronted Ancillary Facility (in each case other than (x) a Rollover

(2) on the date falling thirty (30) Business Days after the expiry of

require repayment of all or any part of its share of the Utilisations and the prepayment of 
any other amount owing to it under the Finance Document or an Issuing Bank (as 
applicable) shall not be entitled to require that any Letter of Credit issued by it are repaid

(i)the Company becomes aware of (by way of a report or any other filing pursuant to 
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, proxy, vote, written notice or otherwise) any 
&quot;person&quot; or &quot;group&quot; of related persons (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) 
and 14(d) of the Exchange Act as in effect on the Closing Date), other than one or 
more Permitted Holders, being or becoming the &quot;beneficial owner&quot; (as defined in 
Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act as in effect on the Closing Date) of more than 
fifty (50) per cent. of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Company,

of all or substantially all of the assets of the Group taken as a whole to a person, 
other than a Restricted Subsidiary or one or more Permitted Holders,
provided that notwithstanding the foregoing:
(A) a transaction will not be deemed to involve a Change of Control solely as 
a result of the Company becoming an indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary 
of a Holding Company if:
(1) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of such Holding 
Company immediately following that transaction are 
substantially the same as the holders of the Company's Voting 
Stock immediately prior to that transaction; or
(2) immediately following that transaction no person (other than a 
Holding Company satisfying the requirements of sub-paragraph 
(1) above or one or more Permitted Holders) is the beneficial 
owner, directly or indirectly, of more than fifty (50) per cent. of 
the Voting Stock of such Holding Company;
(B) no person shall be deemed to acquire beneficial ownership of Voting 
Stock held by any other person or group solely by virtue of (i) the right to 
acquire Voting Stock (so long as such person does not have the right to 
direct the voting of the Voting Stock subject to such right) (ii) any veto 
power in connection with the acquisition or disposition of Voting Stock 
or (iii) a group formed by an agreement with such person and one or more

nominee(s) or representative(s) for, the Board of Directors (unless such 
person (without giving effect to such group) has the right to appoint or 
nominate a majority of the Board of Directors);
(C) a Permitted Transaction under paragraph (a), (b), (d), (e), (h) or (n) thereof 
shall not constitute a Change of Control (provided that, in the case of 
paragraph (e) only, after completion of all relevant steps and/or 
transactions, no Change of Control shall have occurred); and 
(D) any shares issued to a Roll-Up Investor shall not constitute a Change of 
Control.
12.2 Excess Cash Flow
(a) Unless otherwise agreed by the Majority Lenders, the Company will ensure that within 
twenty (20) Business Days of the due date for the delivery of the Annual Financial 
Statements for the relevant Financial Year (commencing with the first complete Financial 
Year following the Closing Date) but subject to Clause 12.3 ( Application of prepayments), 
an amount (if positive) equal to:</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 134 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreement(i)the amount equal to the applicable percentage set out in paragraph (b) below of 
Excess Cash Flow for such Financial Year; less
(ii)the Excess Cash Flow Deduction Amount,
is applied in prepayment of the Term Facilities or (to the extent provided for in paragraph 
(a)(i)(B) of Clause 12.3) other Permitted Indebtedness, in each case pursuant to Clause 12.3 
(Application of prepayments).
(b) The applicable percentage in respect of any mandatory prepayment under paragraph (a) 
above is set out in the table below opposite the applicable Senior Secured Net Leverage 
Ratio as demonstrated by the Annual Financial Statements for such Financial Year and, for 
this purpose, the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio shall be calculated taking into account 
any prepayment made under paragraph (a) above until such time (if any) as such ratio falls 
to the next or subsequent level, whereupon that applicable percentage shall apply:
Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio Percentage of Excess Cash Flow
Greater than 4.45:1 Fifty (50) per cent.
Equal to or less than 4.45:1 but greater than 4.20:1 Twenty-five (25) per cent.
Equal to or less than 4.20:1 Zero (0) per cent.
12.3 Application of prepayments
(a) Unless indicated otherwise, prepayments required to be made:
(i)pursuant to Clause 12.2 ( Excess Cash Flow) shall be applied in the following order:
(A)firstly, in cancellation of the Available Commitments under each Term 
Facility and, at the option of the Company any other available 
commitments which if drawn would constitute Senior Secured 
Indebtedness, pro rata across such Term Facilities and other available 
commitments;
(B)secondly, in prepayment of the Loans under each Term Facility and at the 
option of the Company, any other Senior Secured Indebtedness, pro rata 
across such Term Facilities and other Senior Secured Indebtedness, 
provided that the Company may at its election apply such prepayments in 
prepayment of any Amortising Facility or amortising Senior Secured 
Indebtedness in priority to any Term Facility which is not an Amortising 
Facility;
(C)thirdly, in cancellation of the Available Commitments under each 
Revolving Facility and, at the option of the Company, any other available 
commitments which if drawn would constitute Senior Secured 
Indebtedness, pro rata across such Revolving Facilities and other available 
commitments;
(D)fourthly, in permanent prepayment and cancellation of Revolving Facility 
Utilisations and, at the option of the Company, any other Senior Secured 
Indebtedness, pro rata across such Revolving Facilities and other Senior 
Secured Indebtedness (such that any outstanding Revolving Facility 
Loans shall be prepaid before outstanding Letters of Credit); and</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 135 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreement(E)then, in prepayment and cancellation of the Ancillary Outstandings and 
Ancillary Commitments, Fronted Ancillary Commitments and Fronting 
Ancillary Commitments and, at the option of the Company, any other 
Senior Secured Indebtedness, in each case pro rata across such Ancillary 
Facilities, Fronted Ancillary Facilities and other Senior Secured 
Indebtedness,
provided that for this purpose an amount (the &quot;Excess Cashflow Prepayment 
Amount&quot;) shall (A) be deemed to be applied against an Available Commitment or 
other undrawn commitment if such Available Commitment or other undrawn 
commitment if such Available Commitment or other undrawn commitment is 
cancelled in an amount equal to the Excess Cashflow Prepayment Amount and (B) 
once deemed to be applied shall not be required to be applied in the further 
cancellation or prepayment of any indebtedness or commitments; and
(ii)pursuant to paragraph (c) of Section 4 (Limitation on Sales of Assets and 
Subsidiary Stock) of Schedule 15 ( General Undertakings) shall be applied against 
any or all of the Term Loans, any other Senior Secured Indebtedness and/or (if 
such application would comply with Section 2 (Limitation on Restricted 
Payments) of Schedule 15 ( General Undertakings)) any other Permitted 
Indebtedness, in such proportions as the Company selects in its sole discretion.
For the avoidance of doubt, the amount of any prepayment obligation under this Agreement 
(each a &quot;Prepayment Amount&quot;) shall be reduced to the extent that any part of the relevant 
Prepayment Amount is applied in accordance with any of the provisions above against (or 
otherwise to reduce) any other Senior Secured Indebtedness and/or Permitted Indebtedness.
(b) The obligation to make a mandatory prepayment under paragraph (a) of Clause 12.1 
(Change of Control) shall not be subject to any limitation set out under paragraph (c) below.
(c) Subject to paragraph (b) above, each Obligor shall use all reasonable endeavours and take 
all reasonable steps to ensure that any transaction giving rise to a prepayment obligation or 
obligation to provide cash cover is structured in such a way that it will not be unlawful for 
the Obligors or other members of the Group to move the relevant proceeds received 
between members of the Group, to the extent such action would be necessary to comply 
with such prepayment obligation, to enable a mandatory prepayment to be lawfully made 
and the proceeds lawfully applied as provided under this Clause 12 and/or minimise the 
costs of making such mandatory prepayment. If, however, after each Obligor or other 
member of the Group has used all such reasonable endeavours and taken such reasonable 
steps:
(i)it will still be unlawful for such a prepayment to be made and the proceeds so 
applied; 
(ii)it will still be unlawful to make funds available to a member of the Group that 
could make such a prepayment; 
(iii)it will still result in any member of the Group making funds available to, or 
receiving funds from, another member of the Group to enable such a prepayment 
to be made incurring costs or expenses (including any material Tax liabilities) 
which will exceed three (3) per cent. of the amount of such prepayment or it gives 
rise to a risk of liability for the entity concerned or its directors or officers; and/or
(iv)it will give rise to a risk of liability for a member of the Group and/or its officers 
or directors (or gives rise to a risk of breach of fiduciary or statutory duties by any 
director or officer or a risk of personal liability),</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 136 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreementthen such prepayment shall not be required to be made, subject to, an obligation to use other 
Group cash which is not subject to similar restrictions to prepay an equivalent amount 
where the use of such cash would not be materially prejudicial to overall Group liquidity 
or the availability of Group liquidity to members of the Group requiring funds, provided 
always that if the restriction preventing such payment/provision of cash cover or giving 
rise to such liability is subsequently removed, an amount equal to any relevant proceeds 
will be applied in prepayment and/or the provision of cash cover in accordance with this 
Clause 12 at the end of the relevant Interest Period(s) to the extent that such payment has 
not otherwise been made. 
(d) Notwithstanding the above, no member of the Group shall be required to make any 
prepayment of the Facilities pursuant to Clause 12.2 ( Excess Cash Flow) or Section 4 
(Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock) of Schedule 15 ( General 
Undertakings) at any time when the requirement to make such mandatory prepayment is 
disapplied following the satisfaction of the Release Condition (provided that, for the 
avoidance of doubt, if the Release Condition will be satisfied only following a prepayment 
pursuant to Clause 12.2 ( Excess Cash Flow) or Section 4 (Limitation on Sales of Assets and 
Subsidiary Stock) of Schedule 15 ( General Undertakings) such prepayment shall be 
required to the extent necessary to satisfy the Release Condition). In respect of any 
Released Amounts, if the Release Condition subsequently ceases to be satisfied after the 
date the prepayment would have been required had the Release Condition not been 
satisfied, the failure to apply the Released Amounts in prepayment shall not result in a 
breach of any term of this Agreement.
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event any Net Available 
Cash is received by, or any item is taken into account for the purposes of paragraph (a) of 
the definition of Excess Cash Flow in respect of, any person the entire issued share capital 
of which (or any other ownership interest in) is not owned directly or indirectly by the 
Company, the amount required to be applied in prepayment pursuant to this Agreement in 
respect of such proceeds or such item (after taking account of all applicable exceptions and 
exclusions but without double counting any such deduction) (if any) shall be further 
reduced by a percentage equal to the percentage of the share capital of (or other ownership 
interests in) that person (the entire share capital of which is not held directly or indirectly 
by the Company), and shall then (in respect to such person which is not a member of the 
Group) be limited to such amounts actually received by the shareholder that is the member 
of the Group therein.
(f) For the avoidance of doubt, there shall be no requirement to apply any amount required to 
be applied in prepayment of the Term Facilities pursuant to Clause 12.2 ( Excess Cash Flow) 
or Section 4 (Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock) of Schedule 15 ( General 
Undertakings) in prepayment of any Revolving Facility.
(g) The Company may elect that any prepayment to be made pursuant to Clause 12.2 ( Excess 
Cash Flow) or Section 4 (Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock) of Schedule 
15 (General Undertakings) be applied in prepayment in accordance with this Agreement 
on the last day of the Interest Period relating to the relevant Loan(s) to be repaid. If the 
Company makes that election then a proportion of the Loan(s) equal to the amount of the 
relevant prepayment will be due and payable on the last day of its applicable Interest Period.
(h) To the extent that any portion of any Excess Cash Flow or Net Available Cash from which 
a prepayment of any Term Loan is required to be made is denominated in a currency other 
than the Base Currency applicable to that Term Loan, the prepayment required in respect 
of such Term Loans shall not exceed the net amount of Excess Cash Flow or Net Available 
Cash in the Base Currency applicable to that Term Loan that is actually received by the 
Company upon converting such portion into the Base Currency.</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 137 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreement12.4 Invitation to Refuse Prepayment
(a) The Agent shall notify the Lenders as soon as practicable of any proposed prepayment of 
Term Loans under Clause 11.4 ( Voluntary prepayment of Term Loans), Clause 12.2 ( Excess 
Cash Flow) or Section 4 (Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock) of Schedule 
15 (General Undertakings).
(b) At the Company's request only, a Lender (a &quot;Non-Accepting Lender&quot;) to which the 
proposed prepayment under Clause 11.4 ( Voluntary prepayment of Term Loans), Clause 
12.2 ( Excess Cash Flow) or Section 4 (Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock) 
of Schedule 15 ( General Undertakings) would otherwise be made, may give notice to the 
Agent prior to the deadline specified by the Company in such request (being not less than 
five (5) Business Days from the date of such request or any shorter period agreed between 
the Company and the Agent (acting reasonably)), that such Lender will waive its right to 
receive such prepayment in full (or, with the consent of the Agent (acting reasonably), in 
part) to the extent specified in its notice.
(c) If any Non-Accepting Lender delivers any notice under paragraph (b) above, the amount in 
respect of which that Non-Accepting Lender has waived its right to prepayment (the 
&quot;Waived Amount&quot;) may be retained by the Group for purposes permitted by this 
Agreement (including making Restricted Payments) or, at the Company's option, such 
Waived Amount may be offered to any Lenders under that Facility that do wish to receive 
such further part of the Waived Amount (apportioned between such Lenders in the 
Company's sole and absolute discretion if there is an insufficient amount to meet their

14. INTEREST
14.1 Calculation of interest - Term Rate Loans
The rate of interest on each Term Rate Loan for an Interest Period is the percentage rate per annum 
which is the aggregate of the applicable:
(a) Margin; and
(b) IBOR.
14.2 Calculation of interest - Compounded Rate Loans
(a) In relation to a Compounded Rate Currency, the rate of interest on each Compounded Rate 
Loan for that Compounded Rate Currency for any day during an Interest Period is the 
percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate of the applicable:
(i)Margin; and
(ii)the relevant Compounded Reference Rate for that day for that Compounded Rate 
Currency.
(b) If any day during an Interest Period for a Compounded Rate Loan for a Compounded Rate 
Currency is not an applicable RFR Banking Day in relation thereto, the rate of interest on</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 139 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreementthat Compounded Rate Loan for that day will be the rate applicable to the immediately 
preceding RFR Banking Day.
14.3 Payment of interest
(a) The Borrower to which a Loan has been made shall pay accrued interest on that Loan (i) 
on the last day of each Interest Period and, if the Interest Period is longer than six (6) 
Months, on the dates falling at six (6) Monthly intervals after the first day of the Interest 
Period, or (ii) with respect to any Compounded Rate Loan,  if later, on the date falling three 
(3) applicable RFR Banking Days after the date on which the Agent notifies the relevant 
Borrower of the amount of the relevant Compounded Rate Interest Payment for that Loan 
in respect of that Interest Period in accordance with Clause 14.5 ( Notification of rates of 
interest).
(b) If the Annual Financial Statements and related Compliance Certificate received by the 
Agent show a higher or lower Margin should have applied during a certain period then the 
next payment of interest under the relevant Facility following receipt of the relevant Annual 
Financial Statements by the Agent shall be increased or reduced (as the case may be) by 
such amount as is necessary to put the Agent and the Lenders in the position that they 
should have been in had the appropriate rate of Margin been applied at the time (provided 
that (i) any such reduction shall only apply to the extent the Lender which received the 
overpayment of interest remains a Lender as at the date of such adjustment; (ii) with respect 
to payments to Lenders, such payments shall only apply to Lenders who were participating 
in the relevant Facility both at the time to which the adjustments relate and the time when 
the adjustments are actually made; and (iii) the calculations shall be made on the relevant 
Lenders' participations in the relevant Facility at the time the adjustments are actually 
made).
(c) If (i) any provision of any of this Agreement or any other Finance Document would obligate 
a Canada Borrower or Canada Guarantor to make a payment or payments to a Secured 
Party in an amount or calculated at a rate which would result in the receipt by such Secured 
Party of interest at a criminal rate (as such terms are construed under the Criminal Code 
(Canada)) and (ii) the Criminal Code (Canada) would apply to such payment or payments 
and would have the result of rendering the receipt by such Secured Party of such payment 
or payments criminal, then, notwithstanding such provision, such amount or rate shall be 
deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate, as 
the case may be, as would not so result in the receipt by such Secured Party of interest at a 
criminal rate, such adjustment to be effected, to the extent necessary, as follows: firstly, by 
reducing the amount or rate of interest required to be paid to such Secured Party under the 
applicable Finance Document, and thereafter, by reducing any fees, commissions, 
premiums and other amounts required to be paid to such Secured Party which would 
constitute &quot;interest&quot; for purposes of Section 347 of the Criminal Code (Canada).
14.4 Default interest
(a) If an Obligor fails to pay any amount payable by it under a Finance Document on its due 
date, interest shall, to the extent permitted by law, accrue on the overdue amount from the 
due date up to the date of actual payment (both before and after judgment) at a rate which, 
subject to paragraph (b) below, is one (1) per cent. per annum higher than the rate which 
would have been payable if the overdue amount had, during the period of non-payment, 
constituted a Loan in the currency of the overdue amount for successive Interest Periods, 
each of a duration selected by the Agent (acting reasonably). Any interest accruing under 
this Clause 14.4 shall be immediately payable by the applicable Obligor on demand by the 
Agent.
(b) If any overdue amount consists of all or part of a Term Rate Loan and which became due 
on a day which was not the last day of an Interest Period relating to that Loan:</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 140 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreement(i)the first Interest Period for that overdue amount shall have a duration equal to the 
unexpired portion of the current Interest Period relating to that Loan; and
(ii)the rate of interest applying to the overdue amount during that first Interest Period 
shall be one (1) per cent. higher than the rate which would have applied if the 
overdue amount had not become due.
(c) Default interest (if unpaid) arising on an overdue amount will be compounded (to the extent 
permitted under applicable law) with the overdue amount at the end of each Interest Period 
applicable to that overdue amount but will remain immediately due and payable.

(a) The Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders, the relevant Borrower and the Company of 
the determination of a rate of interest relating to a Term Rate Loan.
(b) The Agent shall promptly upon a Compounded Rate Interest Payment becoming

Rate for such date and any other information that the relevant Borrower may 
reasonably request in relation to the calculation of such rate and amount or the 
determination of that Compounded Rate Interest Payment), in each case taking into 
account the capabilities of any software which the Agent uses to provide such

shall apply to each Interest Period for that Loan.
15.3 Consolidation and division of Term Loans
(a) If two or more Interest Periods:
(i)relate to Term Loans to be made to the same Borrower under the same Facility; 
and
(ii)end on the same date,
those Term Loans will, unless that Borrower requests to the contrary in a Selection Notice 
for the next Interest Period (or has specified to the contrary in the Utilisation Request or a 
Selection Notice previously delivered in accordance with Clause 15.1 ( Selection of Interest

denominated in different currencies, be consolidated into, and treated as, a single Loan 
under the applicable Facility on the last day of the Interest Period.
(b) Subject to Clause 4.4 ( Maximum number of Utilisations) and Clause 5.3 ( Currency and 
amount) if a Borrower (or the Company on its behalf) requests in a Selection Notice that a 
Term Loan be divided into two or more Term Loans under the relevant Facility, that Term 
Loan will, on the last day of its Interest Period, be so divided with Base Currency Amounts 
specified in that Selection Notice, having an aggregate Base Currency Amount equal to the 
Base Currency Amount of the relevant Term Loan immediately before its division.

Base Currency Amount of the Debt Push Term Loan not subject to such Debt 
Pushdown (the &quot;Continuing Loan&quot;);
(iii)the Pushdown Loan and the Continuing Loan shall be treated as separate Term 
Loans under that Facility for all purposes under the Finance Documents; and
(iv)the Interest Period for the Pushdown Loan and the Continuing Loan shall be the 
same as the Interest Period in respect of the Debt Push Term Loan immediately 
prior to such Debt Pushdown.

substantively identical terms (save for any differences that are not material to the 
ongoing operation of such Consolidation Facilities (including, for example, the 
purpose of any Consolidation Facility where such Consolidation Facility is fully 
drawn));
(ii)the Interest Period of all Loans under the Consolidation Facilities end on the same 
day; and</p>

(ii)the rate, if any, notified to the Agent by that Lender as soon as practicable and in 
any event by close of business on the date falling two (2) Business Days after the 
Quotation Day (or, if earlier, on the date falling five (5) Business Days prior to the 
date on which interest is due to be paid in respect of that Interest Period), to be that 
which expresses as a percentage rate per annum the cost to that Lender of funding 
its participation in that Term Rate Loan from the Relevant Market, 
provided that, if the percentage rate per annum notified by the Lender is less than the 
applicable IBOR, or a Lender has not notified the Agent of a percentage rate per annum, 
the cost of that Lender of funding its participation in that Term Rate Loan for that Interest 
Period shall be deemed (for the purposes of this paragraph (a)) to be the applicable IBOR.
(b) In this Agreement, &quot;Market Disruption Event&quot; means:
(i)at or about noon on the Quotation Day for the relevant Interest Period of a Term 
Rate Loan, the applicable IBOR, is to be determined by reference to the Reference 
Banks and none or only one of the Reference Banks supplies a rate to the Agent to 
determine the applicable IBOR, for the relevant currency and Interest Period; or
(ii)before close of business in London on the Quotation Day for the relevant Interest 
Period of a Term Rate Loan, the Agent receives notifications from a Lender or 
Lenders (whose participations in a Loan exceed forty (40) per cent. of that Term 
Rate Loan) that the cost to it of funding its participation in that Term Rate Loan 
from the Relevant Market would be in excess of the applicable IBOR.</p>

authority for the amount so reimbursed following reimbursement by the relevant Lender 
pursuant to this paragraph (s)) as determined by the Relevant Obligor (the &quot;Relevant 
Amount&quot;) and, further, any Obligor shall be entitled, at the sole discretion of the Relevant 
Obligor but provided that the Lender has not already reimbursed the Relevant Obligor for 
the Relevant Amount pursuant to the request by the Relevant Obligor, to set-off an amount 
equal to any Relevant Amount payable by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph (s) against 
any amount payable by an Obligor pursuant to this Agreement (and the Agent or, as the 
case may be, the Security Agent shall treat such set-off as reducing only amounts due to 
the relevant Lender).

(F) (for the avoidance of doubt) is compensated for by Clause 18.8 ( Stamp 
taxes) or Clause 18.9 ( VAT) (or would have been so compensated for

promptly notify the Agent on becoming aware of the event which will give, or has given, 
rise to the claim, following which the Agent will notify the Company and the affected 
Obligor.
(d) A Protected Party shall, on receiving a payment from an Obligor under this Clause 18.4,

received a Tax Payment notwithstanding that such person may have ceased to be a Party.
18.6 Filings
(a) Each Lender shall promptly after becoming a Lender under this Agreement and from time 
to time thereafter submit such forms and documents, complete such other procedural 
formalities and take such other action as may be necessary (at any time) for each Obligor

sentence, solely with respect to the US, the completion, execution and submission of such 
forms, documentation, procedural formalities or other action (other than such forms and 
documentation set forth in paragraph (b) below) shall not be required if in the Lender's 
reasonable judgment such completion, execution, submission or other action would subject 
such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice 
the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
(b) With respect to a Loan or Commitment that is extended to a US Borrower, each Lender, on 
or before the date it becomes a Lender under this Agreement and thereafter if reasonably 
requested by the Agent or such US Borrower, shall promptly provide to the Agent and to

&quot;qualifying intermediary&quot; that assumes primary withholding responsibility under Chapter 
3 and Chapter 4 of the Internal Revenue Code and primary Form 1099 reporting and backup

successor Agent) without withholding or deduction on account of any US federal Tax.

avoidance of doubt, a Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement, Increase Confirmation 
or Additional Facility Lender Accession Notice shall not be invalidated by any failure of a 
Lender to comply with this Clause 18.7.

(a) (for the avoidance of doubt) any such stamp duty, registration, documentary or other similar 
transfer Tax payable in respect of an assignment, novation, transfer or sub-participation of 
a Loan (or part thereof) by that Finance Party or other disposal of a Finance Party's rights 
or obligations under a Finance Document; 
(b) to the extent that such stamp duty, registration, documentary or other similar transfer Tax 
becomes payable upon a voluntary registration made by any Party if such registration is not</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 163 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreementnecessary to evidence, prove, maintain, enforce, compel or otherwise assert the rights of 
such Party or obligations of any Party under a Finance Document; or
(c) any Luxembourg registration duties (droits d'enregistrement) payable in the case of 
voluntary registration of the Finance Documents by a Finance Party with the 
Administration de l'Enregistrement et des Domaines in Luxembourg, or registration of the 
Finance Documents in Luxembourg when such registration is not required to enforce the 
rights of that Finance Party under the Finance Documents.
18.9 VAT
(a) All amounts expressed to be payable under a Finance Document by any Party to a Finance 
Party which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for a supply or supplies for 
VAT purposes shall be deemed to be exclusive of any VAT which is chargeable on such 
supply or supplies and accordingly, subject to paragraph (b) below if VAT is or becomes 
chargeable on any supply or supplies made by any Finance Party to any Party under a 
Finance Document: (i) if such Finance Party is required to account to the relevant tax 
authority for the VAT, then that Party shall pay to such Finance Party (in addition to and at 
the same time as paying any other consideration for that supply or supplies) an amount 
equal to the amount of the VAT upon such Finance Party providing an appropriate VAT 
invoice to such Party; or (ii) if such Party is required to directly account for such VAT 
under the reverse charge procedure provided for by article 44 of the Council Directive 
2006/112/EC or section 7A of the United Kingdom Value Added Tax Act 1994, in each 
case as amended, or any relevant VAT provisions of the jurisdiction in which such Party 
received such supply, then such Party shall account for the VAT at the appropriate rate (and 
the relevant Finance Party must promptly provide an appropriate VAT invoice to such Party 
stating that the amount is charged in respect of a supply that is subject to VAT but that the 
reverse charge procedure applies). 
(b) If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Finance Party (the 
&quot;Supplier&quot;) to any other Finance Party (the &quot;Recipient&quot;) under a Finance Document, and 
any Party other than the Recipient (the &quot;Relevant Party&quot;) is required by the terms of any 
Finance Document to pay an amount equal to the consideration for that supply to the 
Supplier (rather than being required to reimburse or indemnify the Recipient in respect of 
that consideration):
(i)(where the Supplier is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority 
for the VAT) the Relevant Party must also pay to the Supplier (at the same time as 
paying that amount) an additional amount equal to the amount of the VAT. The 
Recipient must (where this sub-paragraph (i) applies) promptly pay to the Relevant 
Party an amount equal to any credit or repayment the Recipient determines it is 
entitled to receive from the relevant tax authority in respect of that supply; and
(ii) (where the Recipient is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority 
for the VAT) the Relevant Party must promptly, following demand from the 
Recipient, pay to the Recipient an amount equal to the VAT chargeable on that 
supply but only to the extent that the Recipient reasonably determines that it is not 
entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant tax authority in respect of that 
VAT.
(c) Where a Finance Document requires any Party to reimburse or indemnify a Finance Party 
for any costs or expenses, that Party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case may be) such 
Finance Party against any VAT incurred by that Finance Party in respect of the costs or 
expenses, to the extent that the Finance Party determines that neither it nor any group of 
which it is a member for VAT purposes is entitled to credit or repayment in respect of the 
VAT from the relevant tax authority.</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 164 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreement(d) Any reference in this Clause 18.9 to any party shall, at any time when such party is treated 
as a member of a group or unity (or fiscal unity) for VAT purposes, include (where 
appropriate and unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to the person who is 
treated as making the supply or (as appropriate) receiving the supply under the grouping 
rules (as provided for in Article 11 of the Council Directive 2006/112/EC (or as 
implemented by the relevant member state of the EU or any other similar provision in any 
jurisdiction which is not a member state of the EU)) (including, for the avoidance of doubt, 
in accordance with section 43 of the UK Value Added Tax Act 1994, as amended) so that 
a reference to a Party shall be construed as a reference to that Party or the relevant group 
or unity (or fiscal unity) of which that Party is a member for VAT purposes at the relevant 
time or the relevant member (or head) of that group or unity (or fiscal unity) at the relevant 
time (as the case may be).
(e) In relation to any supply made by a Finance Party to any Party under a Finance Document, 
if reasonably requested by such Finance Party, that Party must promptly provide such 
Finance Party with details of that Party's VAT registration and such other information as is 
reasonably requested in connection with such Finance Party's VAT reporting requirements 
in relation to such supply.
18.10 FATCA Deduction
(a) Each Party may make any FATCA Deduction it is required to make by FATCA, and any 
payment required in connection with that FATCA Deduction, and no Party shall be required 
to increase any payment in respect of which it makes such a FATCA Deduction or 
otherwise compensate the recipient of the payment for that FATCA Deduction.
(b) Each Party shall promptly, upon becoming aware that it must make a FATCA Deduction 
(or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of such FATCA Deduction) notify the 
Party to whom it is making the payment and, in addition, shall notify the Company and the 
Agent and the Agent shall notify the other Finance Parties.
18.11 FATCA Information
(a) Subject to paragraph (c) below, each Party shall, within ten (10) Business Days of a 
reasonable request by another Party:
(i)confirm to that other Party whether it is:
(A) a FATCA Exempt Party; or
(B) not a FATCA Exempt Party; and
(ii)supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other information 
relating to its status under FATCA as that other Party reasonably requests for the 
purposes of that other Party's compliance with FATCA; and
(iii)supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other information 
relating to its status as that other Party reasonably requests for the purposes of that 
other Party's compliance with any other law, regulation, or exchange of 
information regime.
(b) If a Party confirms to another Party pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) above that it is a FATCA 
Exempt Party and it subsequently becomes aware that it is not, or has ceased to be a FATCA 
Exempt Party, that Party shall notify that other Party reasonably promptly.
(c) Paragraph (a) above shall not oblige any Party to do anything which would or might in its 
reasonable opinion constitute a breach of:</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 165 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreement(i)any law or regulation;
(ii)any fiduciary duty; or
(iii)any duty of confidentiality.
(d) If a Party fails to confirm whether or not it is a FATCA Exempt Party or to supply forms, 
documentation or other information requested in accordance with paragraph (a)(i) or (a)(ii) 
above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, where paragraph (c) above applies), then such 
Party shall be treated for the purposes of the Finance Documents (and payments under 
them) as if it is not a FATCA Exempt Party until such time as the Party in question provides 
the requested confirmation, forms, documentation or other information.
(e) If a Borrower is a US Tax Obligor or the applicable Agent reasonably believes that its 
obligations under FATCA or any other applicable law or regulation require it, each Lender 
shall, within ten (10) Business Days of:
(i)where an Original Borrower is a US Tax Obligor and the relevant Lender is an 
Original Lender, the date of this Agreement;
(ii)where a Borrower is a US Tax Obligor on a date on which any other Lender 
becomes a Party as a Lender, that date; 
(iii)the date a new US Tax Obligor accedes as a Borrower; or
(iv)where a Borrower is not a US Tax Obligor, the date of a request from the Agent;
supply to the Agent:
(A) a withholding certificate on the applicable Withholding Form or any other 
relevant form; or 
(B) any withholding statement or other document, authorisation or waiver as 
the Agent may require to certify or establish the status of such Lender 
under FATCA or that other law or regulation.
(f) The Agent shall provide any withholding certificate, withholding statement, document, 
authorisation or waiver it receives from a Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) above to the 
relevant Borrower.
(g) If any withholding certificate, withholding statement, document, authorisation or waiver 
provided to the Agent by a Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) above is or becomes materially 
inaccurate or incomplete, that Lender shall promptly update it and provide such updated 
withholding certificate, withholding statement, document, authorisation or waiver to the 
Agent unless it is unlawful for the Lender to do so (in which case the Lender shall promptly 
notify the Agent). The Agent shall provide any such updated withholding certificate, 
withholding statement, document, authorisation or waiver to the relevant Borrower.
(h) The Agent may rely on any withholding certificate, withholding statement, document, 
authorisation or waiver it receives from a Lender pursuant to paragraph (a), (e) or (g) above 
without further verification. The Agent shall not be liable for any action taken by it under 
or in connection with paragraph (e), (f) or (g) above.</p>

any Finance Document on the date when it would have been due.

would have had to pay under this Clause 23 if the amount claimed had been recoverable on

arrangement had not occurred.
23.4 Waiver of defences
Subject to the Guarantee Limitations, the obligations of each Guarantor under this Clause 23 will

any person before claiming from that Guarantor under this Clause 23. This waiver applies 
irrespective of any law or any provision of a Finance Document to the contrary.
23.7 Appropriations
Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the 
Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full, each Finance Party (or any trustee or agent 
on its behalf) may:

that Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect of those amounts, or 
apply and enforce the same in such manner and order as it sees fit (whether against those 
amounts or otherwise) and no Guarantor shall be entitled to the benefit of the same; and

performance by it of its obligations under the Finance Documents or by reason of any 
amount being payable, or liability arising, under this Clause 23:

any other guarantee or security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, the 
Finance Documents by any Finance Party;
(iv)other than where the Finance Party has acted fraudulently or  with wilful 
misconduct to bring legal or other proceedings for an order requiring any Obligor 
to make any payment, or perform any obligation, in respect of which any 
Guarantor has given a guarantee, undertaking or indemnity under Clause 23.1 
(Guarantee and indemnity);
(v)to exercise any right of set-off against any Obligor; and/or
(vi)to claim or prove as a creditor of any Obligor in competition with any Finance 
Party,
in each case, unless the exercise of any such rights is necessary or advisable to avoid any 
risk of personal or criminal liability for any current or former Officer of that Guarantor.
(b) If a Guarantor receives any benefit, payment or distribution in relation to such rights, it 
shall, other than to the extent such Guarantor is permitted to retain such benefit, payment 
or distribution in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement hold that benefit, payment 
or distribution to the extent necessary to enable all amounts which may be or become 
payable to the Finance Parties by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance 
Documents to be repaid in full on trust for, or if the concept of trust is not recognised in the 
jurisdiction of incorporation of that Guarantor, for the benefit of (to the extent it is able to 
do so in accordance with any law applicable to it) the Finance Parties and shall promptly 
pay or transfer the same, but subject to the Guarantee Limitations, to the Agent or as the 
Agent may direct for application in accordance with Clause 35 (Payment Mechanics).
23.9 Release of Guarantors' right of contribution
If any Guarantor (a &quot;Retiring Guarantor&quot;) ceases to be a Guarantor in accordance with the terms 
of the Finance Documents for the purpose of any sale, other disposal or transaction of that Retiring 
Guarantor or any of its Holding Companies then on the date such Retiring Guarantor ceases to be a 
Guarantor:
(a) that Retiring Guarantor is released by each other Guarantor from any liability (whether 
past, present or future and whether actual or contingent) to make a contribution to any other 
Guarantor arising by reason of the performance by any other Guarantor of its obligations 
under the Finance Documents; and
(b) each other Guarantor waives any rights it may have by reason of the performance of its 
obligations under the Finance Documents to take the benefit (in whole or in part and 
whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Finance Parties under any 
Finance Document or of any other security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, any 
Finance Document where such rights or security are granted by or in relation to the assets 
of the Retiring Guarantor.

(a) Without limiting any specific exemptions set out below and notwithstanding any other 
provision of this Agreement or any other Finance Document to the contrary:
(i)no Guarantor's obligations and liabilities under this Clause 23 and under any other 
guarantee or indemnity provision in a Finance Document (the &quot;Guarantee 
Obligations&quot;) will extend to include any obligation or liability; and
(ii)no Transaction Security granted by a Guarantor will secure any Guarantee 
Obligation,

prescribed whitewash or similar financial assistance procedures) in respect of the 
acquisition of shares in itself or its Holding Company or a member of the Group under the 
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation.
(b) If, notwithstanding paragraph (a) above, the giving of the guarantee in respect of the 
Guarantee Obligations or Transaction Security would be unlawful financial assistance, 
then, to the extent necessary to give effect to paragraph (a) above (and only to the extent 
legally effective in the Relevant Jurisdiction), the obligations under the Finance Documents 
will be deemed to have been split into two tranches; &quot;Tranche 1&quot; comprising those 
obligations which can be secured by the Guarantee Obligations or Transaction Security 
without breaching or contravening relevant financial assistance laws and &quot;Tranche 2&quot; 
comprising the remainder of the obligations under the Finance Documents. The Tranche 2 
obligations will be excluded from the relevant Guarantee Obligations.

by such Guarantor of a security interest to secure, such Swap Obligation (or any Guarantee 
thereof) is or becomes illegal under the CEA or any rule, regulation or order of the US 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (or the application or official interpretation of 
any thereof) by virtue of such Guarantor's failure for any reason to constitute an &quot;eligible 
contract participant&quot; as defined in the CEA and the regulations thereunder at the time the 
guarantee given by such Guarantor or the grant of such security interest becomes effective 
with respect to such Swap. If a Swap Obligation arises under a master agreement governing 
more than one Swap, such exclusion shall apply only to the portion of such Swap Obligation 
that is attributable to Swaps for which such guarantee or security interest is or becomes 
illegal.</p>

prior to any relevant Purchase (as defined below)), the Company may:
(i)if during such period any member of the Group (by merger or otherwise) has made 
or committed (unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) to make an Investment in 
any person that thereby becomes (or that the Company expects in good faith, based 
upon such commitment, will become) a Restricted Subsidiary or otherwise has 
acquired or committed (unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) to acquire any 
entity, business, property or other asset (including the acquisition, opening and/or 
development of any new site or operation) (any such Investment, acquisition or 
commitment therefor, a &quot;Purchase&quot;), including any such Purchase occurring in 
connection with a transaction causing a calculation to be made under this

attributable to the assets which are the subject of such Purchase during such 
Relevant Period shall be included as if the Purchase occurred on the first day of 
such Relevant Period; and/or
(ii)include an adjustment in respect of any Purchase and/or any steps taken or 
committed or expected (in each case, unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) to 
be taken in respect of such Purchase up to the amount of the pro forma increase in</p>

or will be, achieved (in full or in part) at any time during such Relevant 
Period directly or indirectly as a consequence of the Purchase or any 
related steps, without prejudice to the Synergies actually realised during 
the Relevant Period and already included in Consolidated EBITDA

any time during such Relevant Period, it may be assumed they were 
realised during the entire such Relevant Period; and/or

(unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) to make a disposal of any person, 
property, business or material fixed asset or any group of assets constituting an 
operating unit of a business sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by the Group 
(any such sale, transfer, disposition or commitment therefor, a &quot;Sale&quot;) or if the 
transaction giving rise to the need to calculate Consolidated EBITDA relates to 
such a Sale, calculate Consolidated EBITDA for such period on the basis that 
Consolidated EBITDA will be reduced by an amount equal to the earnings before 
interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and impairment (calculated on the same 
basis as Consolidated EBITDA, mutatis mutandis) (if positive) attributable to the 
assets which are the subject of such Sale for such period or increased by an amount 
equal to the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and 
impairment (calculated on the same basis as Consolidated EBITDA, mutatis 
mutandis) (if negative) attributable thereto for such period as if the Sale occurred 
on the first day of such Relevant Period; and/or
(ii)include an adjustment in respect of any Sale and/or any steps taken or committed 
or expected (in each case, unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) to be taken in 
respect of such Sale up to the amount of the pro forma increase in Consolidated

during such Relevant Period, it may be assumed they were realised during 
the entire such Relevant Period; and/or

within the applicable Look-Forward Period directly or indirectly as a 
consequence of the Sale or any related steps (the &quot;Forward-Looking Sale

Finance Documents, including when determining (or, as applicable, forecasting) 
Consolidated EBITDA for any Relevant Period (including the portion thereof occurring 
prior to implementing or committing to implement such Group Initiative), the Company 
may:

related provisions of the Finance Documents (including this Clause 26, Schedule 15 
(General Undertakings), Schedule 17 ( Certain New York Law Defined Terms) and any 
Applicable Metric):
(i)all calculations will be as determined in good faith by an Officer of the Company 
(including in respect of Synergies); and
(ii)all calculations in respect of Synergies (in each case actual or anticipated) may be 
made as though the full run-rate effect of such Synergies were realised on the first 
day of the Relevant Period.
(g) Periods prior to the Closing Date
Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Net Income for any part of a Relevant Period 
falling prior to the Closing Date shall be calculated on an actual basis over the Relevant 
Period (whereby for any part of the applicable Relevant Period falling prior to the date on 
which the Target Group became part of the Group, such amount shall be calculated based 
on actual historic data for the corresponding period available and by reference to the Target 
Group as adjusted in accordance with the provisions of this Clause and the other provisions 
of this Agreement) or, at the Company's option, on the basis of the Base Case Model.
(h) Business Day adjustments
In the event that:
(i)any Accounting Reference Date or other Quarter Date is adjusted by the Company 
to avoid an Accounting Reference Date or other Quarter Date falling on a day 
which is not a Business Day and/or to ensure that an Accounting Reference Date 
or other Quarter Date falls on a particular day of the week; or
(ii)there is any adjustment to a scheduled payment date to avoid payments becoming 
due on a day which is not a Business Day,
if that adjustment results in any amount being paid in a Relevant Period in which it would 
otherwise not have been paid, for the purpose of calculating any Applicable Metric under 
the Finance Documents the Company may (at its option) treat such amount as if it was paid 
in the Relevant Period in which it would have been paid save for any such adjustment.

Unless a contrary indication appears, a reference in the Finance Documents to Consolidated 
Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA, LTM EBITDA, the Senior Secured Net Leverage 
Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Net Leverage Ratio or the Fixed 
Charge Coverage Ratio is to be construed as a reference to Consolidated Net Income,

Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Net Leverage Ratio or the Fixed Charge Coverage 
Ratio of the Group on a consolidated basis.</p>

supplemented and/or updated on or prior to the Closing Date, to the extent such 
amendment, variation, supplement and/or update is not materially prejudicial to 
the Lenders) and/or any base case model or quality of earnings report relating to a 
Permitted Acquisition prepared by an independent third party and which is 
delivered by the Company (or on its behalf) to the Agent and/or (ii) taken into 
account in determining (x) Opening Consolidated EBITDA or (y) the financing 
EBITDA to be used in connection with financing for a Permitted Acquisition.

basis (in whole or in part) for permitting any transaction or making any determination under 
this Agreement (including on a pro forma basis) no item shall be included or excluded more 
than once where to do so would result in double counting.
(l) Applicable Metrics may be determined as at Applicable Test Date
Any Applicable Metric to be determined in connection with an Applicable Transaction 
may, at the Company's option, be determined as at the Applicable Test Date provided that 
when making such determination the Company shall be required to give pro forma effect 
to any other Applicable Transactions that have occurred up to (and including) the 
Applicable Test Date.
(m) No re-testing of Applicable Metrics unless Company elects</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 205 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties AgreementIf compliance with an Applicable Metric is established in accordance with paragraph (l) 
above, such Applicable Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) 
for all purposes; provided that:
(i)the Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to recalculate any Applicable Metric 
on the basis of a more recent Applicable Test Date, in which case, such date of 
redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the relevant Applicable Test Date 
for purposes of such Applicable Metrics; and
(ii)save as contemplated in sub-paragraph (i) above, compliance with any Applicable 
Metric shall not be determined or tested at any time after the relevant Applicable 
Test Date for such transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto.

Metric (or any other Applicable Metric), such Applicable Metric will not be deemed to 
have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations.
(o) Related requirements and conditions; Defaults and Events of Default
If any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing 
Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested 
as at the Applicable Test Date would at any time after the Applicable Test Date not have 
been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of a 
Default or an Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to 
have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default 
shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing).
(p) Applicable Transactions to be given effect for Applicable Metric calculations after 
Applicable Test Date
Subject to paragraph (c)(viii) of Section 1 (Limitation on Indebtedness) of Schedule 15 
(General Undertakings), in calculating the availability under any Applicable Metric in 
connection with any action or transaction unrelated to the Applicable Transaction following 
the relevant Applicable Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such 
Applicable Transaction is consummated or the Company determines (in its sole discretion) 
that such Applicable Transaction will not be consummated, any such Applicable Metric 
shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Applicable Transaction.
(q) Treatment of revolving Indebtedness for working capital purposes 
If an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof)

is undertaken or any Applicable Metric is tested in reliance on a ratio-based basket based 
on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total 
Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Total Net Leverage Ratio or any other ratio based 
Applicable Metric (including the Financial Covenant), such ratio(s) shall be calculated 
without regard to the Incurrence or drawing of any Indebtedness outstanding on the 
Applicable Test Date (or any other date of calculation) to finance the working capital needs 
of the Group under any revolving facility, letter of credit facility or bank guarantee facility 
and/or other debt (to the extent such other debt is available to be re-drawn and applied for 
working capital or general corporate purposes) (including under any Revolving Facility, or 
any Ancillary Facility and, in each case, any Rollover Loans in respect thereof) and, for the 
avoidance of doubt, subject to paragraph (c)(viii) of Section 1 (Limitation on Indebtedness)</p>

(including under a Revolving Facility) shall be disregarded for the purposes of testing the 
Applicable Metric.
(r) Concurrent testing of ratio-based permissions with fixed permissions and/or Incurrences of 
revolving Indebtedness
If, in connection with the same Applicable Transaction or otherwise substantially 
simultaneously:
(i)
(A) any Applicable Metrics required to be determined by reference to a fixed 
currency amount or a percentage of LTM EBITDA (a &quot;fixed 
permission&quot;) are intended to be utilised; and/or
(B) revolving Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness under the Reserved 
Indebtedness Amount) is intended to be Incurred; and
(ii)any Applicable Metric required to be determined by reference to the Senior 
Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Net 
Leverage Ratio, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or any other ratio-based 
Applicable Metric (a &quot;ratio-based permission&quot;) are intended to be utilized 
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any determination of any increase or 
decrease in any such Applicable Metric, including in accordance with paragraphs 
(b)(i)(C), (b)(i)(D), (b)(i)(E), (b)(v)(B)(1)(I), (b)(v)(B)(1)(II) or (b)(v)(B)(1)(III) 
of Section 1 (Limitation on Indebtedness) of Schedule 15 ( General Undertakings), 
or paragraphs (b)(xvii)(B), (b)(xix)(B) or (b)(xxiv) of Section 2 (Limitation on 
Restricted Payments) of Schedule 15 ( General Undertakings)),

the applicable ratio-based permissions shall first be calculated without giving effect to 
amounts to be incurred or Restricted Payments made, as applicable, under the applicable 
fixed permissions or the applicable Incurrence of revolving Indebtedness, or amounts 
previously incurred or Restricted Payments made, as applicable, under such fixed 
permissions and not reclassified that are being repaid in connection with such Applicable 
Transaction, unless otherwise elected by the Company; and (y) thereafter, compliance with 
any relevant fixed permissions shall be calculated, and in each case, full pro forma effect 
shall be given to all increases to LTM EBITDA and repayments or discharges of 
Indebtedness or Restricted Payments, as applicable, in connection with such Applicable 
Transaction in accordance with this Agreement.
(s) Numerical and grower permissions
If any Applicable Metric is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed amount (the 
&quot;numerical permission&quot;) and a percentage of LTM EBITDA (the &quot;grower permission&quot;) 
and the grower permission of the Applicable Metric exceeds the applicable numerical 
permission (i) at any time as a result of a Permitted Acquisition or Permitted Investment 
(taking into account any adjustments or Forward-Looking Purchase Synergies in respect of 
such transaction) or (ii) on any Test Date, the numerical permission shall be deemed to be 
increased and reset to the highest amount of the grower permission reached from time to 
time as a result of any such Permitted Acquisitions and/or Permitted Investments or any 
Test Date and shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the grower 
permission.
(t) Reclassification</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 207 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties AgreementIn the event that any amount or transaction meets the criteria of more than one Applicable 
Metric, the Company may (in its sole discretion), subject to the limitations imposed under 
paragraph (c)(ii) of Section 1 (Limitation on Indebtedness) of Schedule 15 ( General 
Undertakings), classify and reclassify that amount or transaction to a particular Applicable 
Metric and will only be required to include that amount or transaction in one of those 
Applicable Metrics (and, for the avoidance of doubt, an amount may at the option of the 
Company be split between different Applicable Metrics).
(u) Automatic reclassification into ratio-based permissions
Subject to the limitations imposed under paragraph (c)(ii) of Section 1 (Limitation on 
Indebtedness) of Schedule 15 ( General Undertakings), if a proposed action, matter, 
transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed 
permission and at a later time would subsequently be permitted under a ratio-based 
permission, unless otherwise elected by the Company, such action, matter, transaction or 
amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based 
permission.
(v) Foreign exchange rates and currency conversions
For purposes of determining compliance with:
(i)any Sterling-denominated Applicable Metric (other than in respect of any 
calculation of any financial covenant or ratio under the Finance Documents or 
related usage, ratchet or permission), the Sterling equivalent of amounts 
denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated using a rate of exchange 
selected by the Company (acting in good faith) on the Applicable Test Date 
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the rate of any foreign exchange transaction 
entered into by the Group in relation to the Applicable Transaction); or
(ii)any other Applicable Metric (including in respect of any calculation of any 
financial covenant or ratio under the Finance Documents), the Sterling equivalent 
of amounts denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated, at the 
Company's option, using any of:
(A) any applicable weighted average spot conversion rates over the relevant 
Testing Period;
(B) any applicable conversion rates used in any relevant financial statements 
or management accounts;
(C) any applicable conversion rate selected by the Company (acting in good 
faith) on the relevant date of determination (including the Applicable Test 
Date, if applicable); 
(D) any applicable conversion rate under any foreign exchange hedging 
arrangement entered into by any member of the Group; 
(E) in respect of EUR amounts, the Closing GBP/EUR Conversion Rate; or
(F) in respect of USD amounts, the Closing GBP/USD Conversion Rate,
and, in each case, no Default, Event of Default or any breach of representation or warranty 
or undertaking shall arise merely as a result of a subsequent change in the Sterling 
equivalent amount of any relevant amount due to fluctuations in exchange rates provided, 
however, in each case, that the Company (acting in good faith) may change the exchange 
rates selected by it under this paragraph (v) at any time (and from time to time) and that the</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 208 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties AgreementCompany (acting in good faith) may select different exchange rates for different Applicable 
Metrics or components of any Applicable Metric in such manner as it deems appropriate in 
its sole discretion.
(w) Carry forward and carry back
For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a Financial Year, a calendar year, a 
Relevant Period, a four-quarter period, a twelve (12) month period or any other similar

<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 219 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreementthe relevant failure to comply with the Financial Covenant shall be treated as 
having been cured or prevented, provided that, in relation to any Recalculation 
effected:

for the Applicable Period, the Compliance Certificate for that 
Applicable Period shall set out the revised Financial Covenant 
for the Applicable Period following such Recalculation (or shall 
confirm that the Test Condition is not met following such 
Recalculation); and

the Applicable Period, the Company shall deliver to the Agent a 
revised Compliance Certificate which shall set out the revised 
Financial Covenant for the Applicable Period following such 
Recalculation (or shall confirm that the Test Condition was not 
met for the Applicable Period following such Recalculation),

connection with a Recalculation may also reflect any Cure Amount provided and 
designated in accordance with paragraph (b) above.

forma effect to all Applicable Transactions (and any permitted adjustments to any 
Applicable Metric in connection therewith) for which the Applicable Transaction Date has 
occurred following the end of the Applicable Period or any subsequent Relevant Period as 
if such Applicable Transaction had been consummated on the first day of such Applicable

If the Financial Covenant has been breached, but:
(i)is complied with when tested on any subsequent Test Date; or
(ii)the Test Condition is not satisfied on any subsequent date (whether or not such 
date is a Test Date),
then, any prior breach of the Financial Covenant or any Default or Event of Default arising 
therefrom shall not (and shall not be deemed to) directly or indirectly constitute, or result 
in, a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the Finance 
Documents or a Default or an Event of Default, unless a Declared RCF Default has arisen 
and is continuing before delivery of the Compliance Certificate in respect of the Relevant 
Period ending on the subsequent Test Date or the subsequent date on which the Test 
Condition is not satisfied.

(j) The consent of any Fronting Issuing Bank is required for an assignment or transfer of any 
Lender's rights or obligations under a Revolving Facility in respect of which it is a Fronting 
Issuing Bank, unless the potential New Lender:
(i) is an Existing Lender or an Affiliate of an Existing Lender;
(ii)is on the Approved List; or</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 229 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreement(iii)has a long term credit rating equal to or better than BBB- or Baa3 (as applicable)

(k) Without prejudice to this Clause 29.3, the Company and each other Obligor hereby 
expressly consent to each Transfer permitted pursuant to this Clause 29. The Company and 
each other Obligor also accepts and confirms that all guarantees, indemnities and Security 
granted by it under any Finance Document will, notwithstanding any such Transfer, 
continue and be preserved for the benefit of the New Lender and each of the other Finance 
Parties in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents.
(l) If:
(i)a Lender Transfers, creates a trust over or otherwise disposes of any of its rights 
or obligations under the Finance Documents or changes its Facility Office; and
(ii)as a result of circumstances existing at the date the Transfer, trust or other change 
occurs, an Obligor would be obliged to make a payment or increased payment to 
the Lender (in the case of a sub-participation), the New Lender or Lender acting 
through its new Facility Office under Clause 18 (Taxes) or Clause 19 (Increased 
Costs),
then the New Lender (and the Lender, in the case of a sub-participation), sub-participant, 
beneficiary and/or Lender acting through its new Facility Office is only entitled to receive 
payment under those Clauses to the same extent as the Existing Lender or Lender acting 
through its previous Facility Office would have been if the Transfer, trust or other change 
had not occurred, provided that no Lender may Transfer, create a trust over or otherwise 
dispose of its rights or obligations under the Finance Documents or change its Facility 
Office if the Transfer, trust or other change would give rise to a requirement to prepay on 
illegality under Clause 11.1 ( Illegality) in relation to the New Lender or the Existing Lender 
acting through its new Facility Office.
(m) Each New Lender, by executing the relevant Transfer Certificate or Assignment 
Agreement, confirms, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Agent has authority to execute 
on its behalf any amendment or waiver that has been approved by or on behalf of the 
requisite Lender or Lenders in accordance with this Agreement on or prior to the date on 
which the Transfer becomes effective in accordance with this Agreement and that it is 
bound by that decision to the same extent as the Existing Lender would have been had it 
remained a Lender.
(n) Any Transfer by a Lender without the Company's consent (A) to any person to whom 
proviso (B) (Overriding Restrictions) of paragraph (b) of Clause 29.3 ( Conditions of 
Transfer) (or any provision thereof) applies (a &quot;Disqualified Institution&quot;) or (B) to the 
extent the Company's consent is required under this Clause 29.3, to any other Person, shall 
be subject to the provisions of this paragraph (n), and the Company shall be entitled to seek 
specific performance to unwind any such Transfer and/or specifically enforce this 
paragraph (n) in addition to injunctive relief or any other remedies available to the 
Company at law or in equity; it being understood and agreed that (A) the Company and its 
Subsidiaries may suffer irreparable harm if any Lender breaches any obligation under this 
Clause 29.3 as it relates to any Transfer or pledge of any Loan or Commitment to any 
Disqualified Institution or any other Person to whom the Company's consent is required but 
not obtained and (B) notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Clause 29.3, any 
subsequent Transfer by any Disqualified Institution (or any other Person to which a 
Transfer was made without the required consent of the Company) to an assignee, transferee 
or subparticipant that complies with the requirements of this paragraph (n) (an &quot;Eligible 
Assignee&quot;) will be deemed to be a valid and enforceable Transfer for purposes hereof and 
each subsequent upstream Transfer to an Eligible Assignee in respect of that participation</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 230 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreementshall also be deemed to be valid and effective. Nothing in this paragraph (n) shall be deemed 
to prejudice any right or remedy that the Company may otherwise have at law or equity.
(o) If any Transfer is executed (or purported to be executed) in breach of the provisions of this 
Clause 29 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any purported Transfer to (1) a 
Disqualified Institution or (2) for which the Company's consent has been provided but 
which is purported to be effected on terms different to those disclosed in the relevant 
Transfer Consent Request) (any such person, a &quot;Disqualified Person&quot;) then (x) that 
Transfer shall not be effective, provided that any subsequent upstream Transfer in respect 
of any such relevant participation to an Eligible Assignee will be deemed to be valid and 
effective, (y) any Lender which is party to such purported Transfer (whether as an Existing 
Lender or a proposed New Lender) shall be a &quot;Transfer Defaulting Lender&quot; and (z) the 
Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to the applicable Disqualified 
Person and the Agent:
(i)terminate any Commitment of such Disqualified Person and repay all obligations 
of the relevant member of the Group owing to such Disqualified Person;
(ii)in the case of any outstanding Loans, held by such Disqualified Person, purchase 
such Loans by paying the lesser of (x) par and (y) the amount that such Disqualified

all other amounts payable to it hereunder; and/or
(iii)require such Disqualified Person to Transfer without recourse (in accordance with 
and subject to the restrictions contained in this Clause 29.3), all of its interests, 
rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more Eligible Assignees,
provided that:
(A) in the case of paragraph (i) above, the applicable Disqualified Person has 
received payment of an amount equal to the lesser of (x) par and (y) the 
amount that such Disqualified Person paid for the applicable Loans and 
participations in Letters of Credit, plus accrued interest thereon, accrued 
fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the Company;
(B) in the case of paragraphs (i) and (ii) above, the Company shall not be liable 
to the relevant Disqualified Person for any Break Costs if any Loan owing 
to such Disqualified Person is repaid or purchased other than on the last 
day of the Interest Period relating thereto; and
(C) in the case of paragraph (iii), the relevant Transfer shall otherwise comply 
with this Clause 29.3 (except that no assignment or transfer fee required 
under Clause 29.5 ( Assignment or transfer fee) shall be required with any 
Transfer pursuant to this paragraph).
(p) Any Disqualified Person identified by the Company to the Agent (A) shall not be permitted 
to (x) receive information or reporting provided by any Obligor, the Agent or any Lender 
and/or (y) attend and/or participate in conference calls or meetings attended solely by the 
Lenders and the Agent, and (B) (x) shall not for the purpose of determining whether the 
Lenders have (i) consented (or not consented) to any amendment, modification, waiver, 
consent or other action with respect to any of the terms of any Finance Document or any 
departure by any Obligor therefrom, (ii) otherwise acted on any matter related to any 
Finance Document, or (iii) directed or required the Agent or any Lender to undertake any 
action (or refrain from taking any action) with respect to or under any Finance Document, 
have a right to consent (or not consent), otherwise act or direct or require the Agent or any 
Lender to take (or refrain from taking) any such action; it being understood that all Loans 
held by any Disqualified Person shall be deemed to be not outstanding for all purposes of</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 231 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreementcalculating whether the Lenders have taken any action, and (y) shall be deemed to vote in 
the same proportion as Lenders that are not Disqualified Persons for purposes of any matter 
requiring the consent of each Lender or each affected Lender and (C) shall not be entitled 
to receive the benefits of Clause 22 (Costs and Expenses). For the avoidance of doubt, the 
provisions in this paragraph (p) shall not apply to any Person that is an assignee of any 
Disqualified Person, if such assignee is not a Disqualified Person and, for the avoidance of 
doubt, any subsequent upstream Transfer in respect of any such relevant participation to 
any person that is not a Disqualified Person shall be deemed to be valid and effective.
(q) Notwithstanding the terms of the Finance Documents, if an Existing Lender which is an 
Original Lender Transfers any or all of its Commitments to a New Lender (including an 
Affiliate or Related Fund) on or prior to the end of the Certain Funds Period (the &quot;Pre-
Closing Transferred Commitments&quot;) the Existing Lender shall:
(i)fund the Pre-Closing Transferred Commitments in respect of that Loan by 
9.30 a.m. on the applicable Utilisation Date if that New Lender has failed to so 
fund (or has confirmed that it will not be able to fund) on the applicable Utilisation

(ii)retain exclusive control over all rights and obligations with respect to the Pre-
Closing Transferred Commitments, including all rights with respect to waivers, 
consents, modifications, amendments and confirmations as to satisfaction of the 
requirement to receive all of the documents and other evidence listed in Part I 
(Conditions Precedent to first Utilisation) of Schedule 2 ( Conditions Precedent) 
until after the expiry of the Certain Funds Period.
(r) Any assignment or transfer by an Existing Lender to a New Lender shall only be effective 
if it transfers or assigns the Existing Lender's share of the relevant Facility pro rata against 
the Existing Lender's Available Commitment and its participations in Utilisations under 
that Facility.
29.4 Assignments by Lenders
Upon an assignment becoming effective, the Existing Lender will be released from its obligations 
under the Finance Documents to the extent they are assumed by the New Lender.
29.5 Assignment or transfer fee
Unless the Agent agrees otherwise, the New Lender shall, on or before the date upon which an 
assignment or transfer to it takes effect pursuant to this Clause 29, pay to the Agent (for its own

(a) no such fee shall be payable in connection with an assignment or transfer made in 
connection with primary syndication of the Facilities;
(b) no such fee shall be payable in respect of any assignment or transfer by a Lender to an 
Affiliate or a Related Fund of that Lender;

Documents, the Transaction Security or any other documents;
(ii)the financial condition of any member of the Group;
(iii)the performance and observance by any member of the Group of its obligations

Secured Parties that it:
(i)has made (and shall continue to make) its own independent investigation and 
assessment of the financial condition and affairs of each Obligor and its related 
entities and all other risks arising in connection with its participation in the Finance 
Documents and has not relied exclusively on any information provided to it by the 
Existing Lender or any other Finance Party in connection with any Transaction 
Document or the Transaction Security; and
(ii)will continue to make its own independent appraisal of the creditworthiness of each 
Obligor and its related entities whilst any amount is or may be outstanding under 
the Finance Documents or any Commitment is in force.
(c) Each New Lender confirms to the Company that it has all Authorisations required for 
lending to the Borrowers under the Facility in which it is a Lender.
(d) Nothing in any Finance Document obliges an Existing Lender to:
(i)accept a re-transfer or re-assignment from a New Lender of any of the rights and 
obligations assigned or transferred by such Existing Lender under this Clause 29; 
or
(ii)support any losses directly or indirectly incurred by the New Lender by reason of 
the non-performance by any Obligor of its obligations under the Transaction 
Documents or otherwise.

receipt of a duly completed Transfer Certificate which appears on its face to comply with

<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 233 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreement(c) The Agent shall only be obliged to execute a Transfer Certificate delivered to it in 
accordance with the provisions of this Clause 29.7 once it is satisfied it has complied with 
all necessary &quot;know your customer&quot; or similar checks under all applicable laws and 
regulations in relation to the transfer to such New Lender.
(d) Each Party (other than the Existing Lender and the New Lender) irrevocably authorises the 
Agent to execute any duly completed Transfer Certificate on its behalf.
(e) On the Transfer Date:
(i)to the extent that in such Transfer Certificate the Existing Lender seeks to transfer 
by novation its rights and obligations under the Finance Documents and in respect 
of the Transaction Security, each of the Obligors and such Existing Lender shall 
be released from further obligations towards one another (and the Existing Lender 
and any Issuing Bank shall be released from any further obligations toward each 
other) under the Finance Documents and in respect of the Transaction Security and 
their respective rights against one another under the Finance Documents and in

obligations acquired or assumed by it as a result of such transfer and to that extent 
the Agent, the Mandated Lead Arrangers and the relevant Existing Lender and the 
other Finance Parties (other than the New Lender) shall each be released from 
further obligations to each other under the Finance Documents; and
(iv)such New Lender shall become a party hereto as a Lender.

(a) Subject to the conditions set out in Clause 29.3 ( Conditions of Transfer) and Clause 41.5 
(Replacement of a Lender), an assignment may be effected in accordance with paragraph 
(c) below when the Agent executes an otherwise duly completed Assignment Agreement 
delivered to it by the Existing Lender and the New Lender. The Agent shall, subject to 
paragraph (b) below, as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt by it of a duly

equivalent to the Relevant Obligations.
29.9 Sub-participations
(a) Notwithstanding Clause 29.3 ( Conditions of Transfer), on or prior to the end of the Certain 
Funds Period, the prior written consent of the Company (which may be given, withheld, 
conditioned or delayed in its sole and absolute discretion and shall not, under any 
circumstances, be deemed given) is required for any Transfer by a Lender by way of a sub-
participation of any Facility unless such Transfer by way of sub-participation is by an 
Original Lender to any of its Affiliates or, in the case of a Term Facility only, its Related 
Fund provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, paragraph (q) of Clause 29.3 ( Conditions 
of Transfer) shall apply to any such Transfer.
(b) Notwithstanding Clause 29.3 ( Conditions of Transfer), after the end of the Certain Funds 
Period, the prior written consent of the Company (which may be given, withheld, 
conditioned or delayed in its sole and absolute discretion and shall not, under any 
circumstances, be deemed given except with respect to a proposed Transfer by way of sub-
participation of Facility B (USD) where such consent will be deemed to have been granted 
if the Company does not respond within fifteen (15) Business Days of receipt by the 
Company and each Designated Recipient of a duly completed Transfer Consent Request) 
is required for any Transfer by a Lender by way of a sub-participation unless:
(i)the proposed sub-participant is not a person to whom proviso (B) (Overriding 
Restrictions) of paragraph (b) of Clause 29.3 ( Conditions of Transfer) (or any 
provision thereof) applies;
(ii)such Lender remains a Lender under this Agreement with all rights and obligations 
pertaining thereto and remains liable under this Agreement and the other Finance 
Documents in relation to those obligations;
(iii)such Lender retains at all times exclusive control over all rights and obligations in 
relation to the participations and Commitments that are the subject of the relevant 
sub-participation, including all voting and similar rights (for the avoidance of 
doubt, free of any agreement or understanding pursuant to which it is required to 
or will consult with any other person in relation to the exercise of any such rights 
and/or obligations);
(iv)the relationship between the Lender and the proposed sub-participant is that of a 
contractual debtor and creditor (including in the bankruptcy or similar event of the 
Lender or an Obligor);
(v)the proposed sub-participant will have no proprietary interest in the benefit of the 
Finance Documents or in any monies received by the relevant Lender under or in 
relation to any of the Finance Documents (in its capacity as sub-participant under 
that arrangement);</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 235 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreement(vi)the proposed sub-participant will under no circumstances (A) be subrogated to, or 
be substituted in respect of, the relevant Lender's claims under any of the Finance 
Documents or (B) otherwise have any contractual relationship with, or rights 
against, the Obligors under or in relation to any of the Finance Documents (in its 
capacity as sub-participant under that arrangement);
(vii)the applicable sub-participation agreement states that the conditions above are 
applicable to further sub-participations (and such provision must be capable of 
being relied upon and directly enforceable by the Company against the relevant 
sub-participant); and
(viii)if the sub-participation is in respect of an Additional Facility, the restrictions (if 
any) specified in the relevant Additional Facility Notice establishing such 
Additional Facility Commitments are complied with,
and, for the avoidance of doubt, paragraph (q) of Clause 29.3 ( Conditions of Transfer) shall 
apply to any sub-participation which occurs in breach of these provisions.
(c) Upon reasonable request by the Company at any time, each Lender which has made a sub-
participation of any or all of its obligations hereunder shall notify the Company of the 
identity of any sub-participant and shall provide any information in reasonable detail 
relating to such sub-participant or such sub-participation agreement or arrangement.
(d) Without prejudice to paragraph (q) of Clause 29.3 ( Conditions of Transfer), if, as a result 
of laws or regulations in force or known to be coming into force at the time of any sub-
participation an Obligor would be obliged to make payment to the Lender of any amount 
required to be paid by an Obligor under Clause 18 (Taxes) or Clause 19 (Increased Costs), 
that Lender shall not be entitled to receive or claim any amount under those Clauses in 
excess of the amount that it would have been entitled to receive or claim if that sub-
participation had not occurred.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Lender which would 
be entitled to receive interest payments from an Obligor without a Tax Deduction had the 
sub-participation not occurred (a &quot;Participating Lender&quot;) enters into a sub-participation 
with any sub-participant that would be entitled to receive such payments without, or with a 
reduced, Tax Deduction, the Participating Lender and such Obligor shall cooperate in good 
faith in complying with the relevant tax certification obligations so that the Obligor may 
make payments to that Participating Lender without, or with a reduced, Tax Deduction, 
where such payment will be applied in making a corresponding payment to a sub-
participant. 
(e) Unless the Company has provided its prior written consent in accordance with this Clause 
29.9 (which may be given, withheld, conditioned or delayed in its sole and absolute 
discretion and shall not, under any circumstances, be deemed given), no sub-participation 
of Commitments made pursuant to this Clause 29.9 shall confer voting or similar rights on 
any sub-participant and any term purporting to grant such rights shall be void and 
unenforceable.

(b) The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest 
error, and the Obligors, the Agent and the Lenders shall treat each person whose name is

Register (and which the Agent shall do promptly) on its behalf for the purposes of this 
Clause 29.10 without any further consent of, or consultation with, such Party. No 
assignment or transfer shall be effective unless recorded in the Register.
(d) The Agent shall, upon request by an Existing Lender (as defined in Clause 29.2 
(Assignments and Transfers by Lenders)) or a New Lender, confirm to that Existing Lender 
or New Lender whether a transfer or assignment from that Existing Lender or (as the case 
may be) to that New Lender has been recorded on the Register (including details of the 
Commitment of that Existing Lender or New Lender in each Facility).
29.11 Sub-participant Register
Each Lender that sells a sub-participation in a Loan or other obligation under a Finance Document

which it enters the name and address of each sub-participant and the principal amounts (and stated 
interest) of each sub-participant's interest in such Loans or other obligations (for the purposes of this 
provision, the &quot;Participant Register&quot;); provided that no such Lender shall have any obligation to 
disclose all or any portion of a Participant Register (including the identity of any sub-participant or 
any information relating to a sub-participant's interest in any Commitments, Loans or other 
obligations under any Finance Document) to any person, except to the extent that such disclosure is 
necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered form within 
the meaning of Section 5f.103-1(c) and Proposed Section 1.163-5(b) of the US Treasury Regulations 
(or, in each case, any amended or successor version). The entries in the Participant Register shall be 
conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded 
in the Participant Register as the owner of such sub-participation for all purposes of the Finance 
Documents notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.
29.12 Copies of documentation
The Agent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after it has executed a Transfer Certificate, an 
Assignment Agreement, Additional Facility Notice, Additional Facility Lender Accession Notice 
or an Increase Confirmation, send to the Company, a copy of that Transfer Certificate, Assignment

Confirmation. The Agent shall provide, upon the request of the Company, in relation to any 
specified Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement, Additional Facility Notice, Additional 
Facility Lender Accession Notice or Increase Confirmation, a copy of such document to the 
Company within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such request.
29.13 Security over Lenders' rights
In addition to the other rights provided to Lenders under this Clause 29, each Lender may without 
consulting with or obtaining consent from the Company or any Obligor, at any time charge, assign 
or otherwise create Security in or over (whether by way of collateral or otherwise) all or any of its 
rights under any Finance Document to secure obligations of that Lender including:</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 237 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreement(a) any charge, assignment or other Security to secure obligations to a federal reserve or central 
bank; and
(b) in the case of any Lender which is a fund, any charge, assignment or other Security granted 
to any holders (or trustee or representatives of holders) of obligations owed, or securities 
issued, by that Lender as security for those obligations or securities,
except that no such charge, assignment or Security shall:
(i)release a Lender from any of its obligations under the Finance Documents or 
substitute the beneficiary of the relevant charge, assignment or other Security for 
the Lender as a party to any of the Finance Documents; or
(ii)require any payments to be made by any Obligor or grant to any person any more 
extensive rights than those required to be made or granted to the relevant Lender 
under the Finance Documents.
29.14Pro rata interest settlement
If the Agent has notified the Lenders that it is able to distribute interest payments on a &quot;pro rata 
basis&quot; to Existing Lenders and New Lenders then (in respect of any transfer pursuant to Clause 29.7 
(Procedure for transfers) or any assignment pursuant to Clause 29.8 ( Procedure for assignment) 
the Transfer Date of which, in each case, is after the date of such notification and is not on the last 
day of an Interest Period):
(a) any interest or fees in respect of the relevant participation which are expressed to accrue by 
reference to the lapse of time shall continue to accrue in favour of the Existing Lender up 
to but excluding the Transfer Date (&quot;Accrued Amounts&quot;) and shall become due and 
payable to the Existing Lender (without further interest accruing on them) on the last day 
of the current Interest Period (or, if the Interest Period is longer than six (6) Months, on the 
next of the dates which falls at six (6) monthly intervals after the first day of that Interest 
Period); and
(b) the rights assigned or transferred by the Existing Lender will not include the right to the 
Accrued Amounts so that, for the avoidance of doubt:
(i)when the Accrued Amounts become payable, those Accrued Amounts will be 
payable for the account of the Existing Lender; and
(ii)the amount payable to the New Lender on that date will be the amount which 
would, but for the application of this Clause 29.14, have been payable to it on that 
date, but after deduction of the Accrued Amounts.
29.15 Accession of Additional Facility Lender
Any person which provides Additional Facility Commitments or an Additional Facility Loan shall 
become a party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Lender and shall, at the same time, become a 
Party as a Lender by executing an Additional Facility Lender Accession Notice.

relevant Finance Documents occurred or was deemed to occur by way of novation, each Obligor

any Luxembourg Obligor, in accordance with the provisions of article 1278 of the Luxembourg

obligations, protections, immunities or indemnities of the Security Agent (the &quot;Security 
Agent Provisions&quot;) as contained in this Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement, on 
the one hand, and in any of the other Finance Documents, on the other hand, the Security 
Agent Provisions contained in this Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement shall 
prevail and apply.
(e) The Security Agent is hereby authorised by the Secured Parties to sign or countersign any 
Assignment Agreement, Transfer Certificate, Additional Facility Notice, Additional 
Facility Lender Accession Notice, Increase Confirmation or similar document in 
connection therewith without investigation or inquiry, if, on its face, it appears to conform

Agent.
32.22 Withholding
To the extent required by any applicable laws, the Agent may withhold from any payment to any 
Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. Each Lender shall indemnify and 
hold harmless the Agent against, and shall make payable in respect thereof within ten (10) Business 
Days after demand therefor, any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities and 
expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Agent) incurred by or</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 258 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreementasserted against the Agent by any governmental authority as a result of the failure of the Agent to 
properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of such Lender for any reason 
(including because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because such 
Lender failed to notify the Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or 
reduction of withholding Tax ineffective). A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability 
delivered to any Lender by the Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby 
authorizes the Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender 
under this Agreement or any other Finance Document against any amount due the Agent under this 
Clause 32.22. The agreements in this Clause 32.22 shall survive the resignation and/or replacement 
of the Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the 
Commitments, the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations and the termination 
of this Agreement.

be imposed on the Agent in relation to the receipt, recovery or distribution; and
(iii)the Recovering Finance Party shall, within three (3) Business Days of demand by

the extent agreed between the Company and any relevant Lender under such Facility and 
notified to the Agent) pursuant to Clause 5.4 ( Lenders' participation) shall not be made 
available to the Agent but rather shall be made available directly to the relevant 
beneficiaries of such payments specified in the relevant Utilisation Request.
35.2 Distributions by the Agent
Each payment received by the Agent under the Finance Documents for another Party shall, subject 
to Clause 35.3 ( Distributions to an Obligor) and Clause 35.4 ( Clawback and pre-funding) be made

actually received that sum.
(b) Unless paragraph (c) below applies, if the Agent pays an amount to another Party and it 
proves to be the case that the Agent had not actually received that amount, then the Party 
to whom that amount (or the proceeds of any related exchange contract) was paid by the</p>

whom that sum was made available shall on demand refund it to the Agent; and

Lender who failed to fund.

required to make a payment under the Finance Documents to the Agent, as the case may

amount direct to the required recipient or pay that amount to an interest bearing account 
held with an Acceptable Rated Bank and in relation to which no Insolvency Event has 
occurred and is continuing, in the name of the Obligor or the Lender making the payment 
and designated as a trust account for the benefit of the Party or Parties beneficially entitled

nothing in the Finance Documents shall prevent, or shall be construed so as to prevent, any 
member of the Group (i) setting-off any amount or payment due from a Defaulting Lender 
against any amount or payment owed by a member of the Group and provided further that 
in the event of any such set-off by a member of the Group, for the purposes of the Finance 
Documents, the Agent or, as the case may be, the Security Agent shall treat such set-off as 
reducing only payments due to the relevant Defaulting Lender and/or (ii) exercising any 
right of counterclaim against a Defaulting Lender or any amount or payment due from a 
Defaulting Lender).
(b) The Agent shall not be liable in any way for any action taken by it pursuant to paragraph

and reflect the matters contemplated by, paragraph (a) above, to reflect the change in 
currency or any generally accepted financial conventions and market practice in the 
Relevant Market relating to dealing in any new currency and, in each case, so far as is

amendment to (or, as the case may be, waiver of) the terms of the Finance Documents

(e) the Agent shall not be liable for any damages, costs or losses whatsoever (including for

Agreement (a &quot;Structural Adjustment Amendment Agreement&quot;) executed and delivered

and the Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of any Structural

adversely affect the rights or interests of Lenders in respect of other Utilisations or Facilities 
by virtue of such amendments, replacements or waivers. For the avoidance of doubt, this 
paragraph (f) is without prejudice to the ability to effect, make or grant any amendment, 
waiver, consent or release pursuant to or in accordance with paragraph (e) above.

<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 273 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties AgreementClause 12.1 ( Change of Control) shall apply in relation to a Change of Control, any waiver 
of that Change of Control shall be at the option of each individual Lender.
(j) Any amendment or waiver which relates only to the provisions governing transfers, 
assignments or sub-participations by Lenders and which makes such provisions more 
restrictive for any of the Lenders (including any amendment to Clause 29 (Changes to the 
Lenders) to the extent further restricting the rights of the Lenders to assign, transfer or sub-
participate their rights or obligations under the Finance Documents) shall only require the 
consent of each Lender who will be subject to the resulting additional restrictions.
(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Finance Documents, a Finance Party may 
unilaterally waive, relinquish or otherwise irrevocably give up all or any of its rights under

Facilities) and the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, no amendment or waiver of 
a term of any Ancillary Document shall require the consent of any Finance Party other than 
the relevant Ancillary Lender or Fronting Ancillary Lender unless such amendment or 
waiver would require an amendment or waiver of this Agreement (including, for the 
avoidance of doubt Clause 9 (Ancillary Facilities)), in such case the other provisions of this 
Clause 41 shall apply.
(m) If the Company or the Agent (at the request of the Company) has requested the Finance 
Parties (or any of them) to give a consent in relation to, or to agree a release, waiver or 
amendment of, any provision of the Finance Documents or other vote of Lenders under the 
terms of this Agreement, then in the case of any Finance Party who has delivered a consent 
or agreement to such request, on and from the date of notification thereof to the Agent, (i) 
that Finance Party shall be deemed to have given its consent or agreement to such request, 
(ii) such consent or agreement shall be deemed to have been received by the Agent and (iii) 
such consent or agreement shall, unless otherwise agreed or stipulated by the Company, 
from such time be irrevocable and binding on such Finance Party and any permitted 
assignee, transferee or counterparty to a sub-participation.
(n) If and only to the extent the Company agrees or stipulates to this effect in connection with 
any consent, release, waiver, amendment or vote under this Agreement, any Finance Party 
or its permitted assignee or transferee that has expressly rejected, not consented or not 
agreed to a request for an amendment, waiver, consent or release shall, unless it is (and 
only until it becomes) a Non-Consenting Lender, have the right to change or revoke its 
decision and subsequently deliver to the Agent a consent or agreement to such request at 
any time during the period for which the vote and request process is open for consents and 
acceptances as determined by the Company and notified by the Agent to such Lender (and 
subject to any extension of such period as agreed between the Company and the Agent). 
For the avoidance of doubt, unless the Company stipulates or agrees otherwise, the period 
for any such process shall end as soon as the requisite Lender consent is received as 
provided in paragraph (m) above.
(o) No amendment or waiver of a term of the Syndication Strategy Letter, any Fee Letter or 
other side letter shall require the consent of any Finance Party other than any such person 
which is party to such letter.

Finance Document made in accordance with Clause 2.2 (Additional Facilities), Clause 2.3 
(Increase), Clause 41.5 ( Replacement of a Lender), Clause 41.9 ( Implementation of

or waived by the Company and the Agent (or, if applicable, the Security Agent) without

manifest inconsistency between a term of a Transaction Security Document and a provision 
of the Agreed Security Principles); reflect changes of a minor, technical or administrative 
nature or manifest error; is otherwise only for the benefit of all or any of the Lenders; or 
(provided that such waiver or amendment does not adversely affect the interests of the 
other Lenders whose consent is not required for the applicable amendment) is consequential 
on, incidental to, or required to implement an approved amendment, waiver, consent or 
release.
(r) Any amendment, waiver, consent or release made or effected in accordance with any of the 
paragraphs of this Clause 41.4, or in accordance with any other term of any of the Finance 
Documents, shall be binding on all Parties. Each Secured Party irrevocably and 
unconditionally authorises and instructs the Agent (for the benefit of the Agent and the 
Company) to execute any documentation relating to a proposed amendment or waiver as 
soon as the requisite Lender consent is received (or on such later date as may be agreed by

revoked or, as the case may be, waived with the consent of the Majority Revolving Facility 
Lenders, or in the case of a Declared RCF Default, the Super Majority Revolving Facility 
Lenders.
(u) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Finance Documents, any re-designation or 
transfer of all or any part of a Commitment and/or a participation in any Utilisation to a 
new tranche or facility established as an Additional Facility or pursuant to a Structural 
Adjustment or any other term of any of the Finance Documents (or any other similar or 
equivalent transaction) may be approved with the consent of the Lender holding that 
Commitment and/or, as the case may be, participation (or part thereof) and the Company 
(without any requirement for any consent or approval from any other person).

of doubt, Majority Lenders and Super Majority Lenders) of Total Commitments and/or 
participations has been obtained to approve that request.
(w) Each Finance Party authorises and instructs the Agent to enter into any amendment or 
waiver of any term of any Finance Document requested by the Company for the purpose

Issuing Bank and which does not impose material additional liabilities or obligations on</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 275 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreementsuch Lenders, group of Lenders and/or Issuing Bank (as applicable), in each case without 
the requirement for any consent of any other Finance Party.
(x) For the avoidance of doubt, any amendment, waiver, consent or release shall require the 
prior written consent of the Company.
(y) As at each date that the Agent or Security Agent determines whether the consent of the 
requisite Finance Parties to any proposed amendment, waiver, consent or release has been 
obtained or whether instructions have been received from the requisite Finance Parties to 
take any action under Clause 28.6 ( Acceleration), each Lender shall be deemed to represent 
to the Company that it is not a Net Short Lender, other than:
(i)any Lender that has notified the Company and the Agent in writing that it is a Net 
Short Lender;
(ii)any Mandated Lead Arranger or Original Lender in respect of the Original 
Revolving Facility (and in each case its Affiliates other than any Hedge Fund); and
(iii)any Lender which is a financial institution authorised by a financial services 
regulator or any Affiliate thereof.
(z) Unless the Company agrees otherwise (in respect of any individual Net Short Lender) the 
participations and Commitments of any Net Short Lender shall be deemed to be zero for 
the purposes of both the numerator and the denominator of the relevant percentage of the

of the Majority Lenders, the Majority Revolving Facility Lenders, the Super Majority 
Lenders, the Super Majority Revolving Facility Lenders, all Lenders, or any other class of 
Lenders (as applicable) have been obtained for all purposes under the Finance Documents, 
including with respect to any request for a consent or agreement or requirement for 
instructions to be given to the Agent or Security Agent.

amendment to any Finance Document to include, implement, amend, alter or remove 
any KPI-Ratchet Provision (including any environmental, social and/or governance KPIs 
in respect thereof) in respect of any Facility may be agreed by the Company and the 
Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Lenders participating in the applicable 
Facility B). For the purpose of this paragraph (aa), &quot;KPI-Ratchet Provision&quot; means 
any provision pursuant to which the Margin in respect of any Facility or Facilities is 
subject to a reduction based upon the achievement of up to two specified 
environmental, social and/or governance KPIs, provided, however, that such 
adjustment to the Margin may not exceed a ten basis points (0.10%) reduction in respect 
of the Margin ratchets set out in the definition of the &quot;Margin&quot; (if certain specified KPIs 
are achieved). For the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph (aa) does not impose any 
obligation on any member of the Group to agree, achieve or report on any 
environmental, social or governance KPI or to agree, negotiate or enter into any KPI-
Ratchet Provision (or any amendments to the Finance Documents in relation thereto). 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if a KPI-Ratchet Provision is agreed with 
respect to the Margin applicable to Facility B, the same KPI-Ratchet Provision shall 
apply with respect to the Margin applicable to the Revolving Facility.

a Restricted Finance Party may in its absolute discretion (but shall be under no obligation to) notify 
in writing to the Agent that it does have, in the given circumstances, the benefit of the provision in

vote of any other Restricted Finance Party which would be required to vote in accordance with the 
provisions of this Agreement and that has not notified the Agent to that effect under this Clause 41.7 
will be excluded for the purpose of determining whether the consent of the requisite Finance Parties 
to approve such Relevant Measure has been obtained or whether the Relevant Measure by the

41.8 Replacement of Screen Rate
(a) Subject to paragraph (d) below, any amendment, replacement or waiver proposed by the 
Company and delivered in writing to the Agent which relates to a change to (i) the 
benchmark rate, base rate or reference rate (the &quot;Benchmark Rate&quot;) to apply in relation to 
a currency in place of the existing Benchmark Rate for such currency under an applicable 
Facility, or (ii) the method of calculation of any Benchmark Rate, (in each case including 
any amendment, replacement or waiver to the definition of &quot;EURIBOR&quot;, &quot;LIBOR&quot;, &quot;IBOR&quot;, 
or &quot;Screen Rate&quot;, including an alternative or additional page, service or method for the 
determination thereof, or which relates to aligning any provision of a Finance Document 
(including amending, replacing or supplementing Schedule 18 ( Compounded Rate Terms) 
and/or Schedule 19 ( Daily Non-Cumulative Compounded RFR Rate)) to the use of that 
Benchmark Rate, including making appropriate adjustments to this Agreement for basis, 
duration, time and periodicity for determination of that Benchmark Rate for any Interest 
Period and making other consequential and/or incidental changes) (a &quot;Benchmark Rate 
Change&quot;), notified by the Company to the Agent, may and shall be made provided that 
(unless otherwise agreed between the Company and the Majority Lenders) either the Agent 
has made a Prevailing Market Determination or no Super Majority Lender Objection has 
occurred and is continuing in respect thereof.
(b) If no Benchmark Rate Change for such currency has been made or implemented pursuant 
to paragraph (a) above and the Company or the Agent (acting on the instructions of the 
Majority Lenders) requests the making of a Benchmark Rate Change and notifies the Agent 
or the Company (as applicable) thereof, then the Company and the Agent (acting on the 
instructions of the Majority Lenders) shall enter into consultations in respect of a 
Benchmark Rate Change in accordance with the terms of paragraph (d) below; provided 
that if such Benchmark Rate Change cannot be agreed upon by the earlier of (x) the end of 
a consecutive period of thirty (30) days and (y) the date which is five (5) Business Days 
before the end of the current Interest Period, (or in the case of a new Utilisation, the date 
which is five (5) Business Days before the date upon which the Utilisation Request will be 
served, as notified by the Company to the Agent), the Benchmark Rate applicable to any 
Lender's share of a Loan for each Interest Period which commences after the Trigger Date 
for the currency of such Loan and prior to (or during) the date on which a Benchmark Rate 
Change for that currency has been agreed shall (unless otherwise agreed by the Company 
and the Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Lenders participating in the 
applicable Facility)) be replaced by the rate certified to the Agent by that Lender as soon as 
practicable (and in any event by the date falling two (2) Business Days before the date on 
which interest is due to be paid in respect of the relevant Interest Period) to be that which 
expresses as a percentage rate per annum the cost to the relevant Lender of funding its 
participation in that Loan in the relevant interbank market.</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 280 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreement(c) Notwithstanding the definitions of &quot;EURIBOR&quot;, &quot;LIBOR&quot;, &quot;IBOR&quot;, or &quot;Screen Rate&quot; in 
Clause 1.1 (Definitions) or any other term of any Finance Document, the Agent may from 
time to time (with the prior written consent of the Company) specify a Benchmark Rate 
Change for any currency for the purposes of the Finance Documents, and each Lender 
authorises the Agent to make such specification.
(d) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Clause 41.8, no Benchmark Rate Change or 
other amendments or waivers in connection therewith shall be made without the prior 
written consent of the Company (which may be given, withheld, conditioned or delayed in 
its sole and absolute discretion and shall not, under any circumstances, be deemed given) 
which:
(i)would result in an increase in the weighted average cost of the applicable Facility 
(whether by an increase in the Margin, fees or otherwise but taking into account, 
to the extent reasonably practicable, any transfer of economic value from one Party 
to another as a result of the application of any Benchmark Rate Change to such 
applicable Facility (including any spread adjustment to reflect the differential 
between the weighted average Benchmark Rate before and after such Benchmark 
Rate Change)) to the Obligors;
(ii)are a change to the date of an interest payment date;
(iii)would result in any Obligor being subject to more onerous obligations under the 
Finance Documents; 
(iv)would result in any rights or benefits of any Obligor under the Finance Documents 
being lost or reduced; or
(v)would include a credit adjustment (or similar), payment of break costs or a fallback 
cost of funds for market disruption.
(e) For the purposes of this Clause 41.8:
&quot;Trigger Date&quot; in respect of the Screen Rate used to calculate any Benchmark Rate means 
the earliest of:
(i)the date upon which the administrator of that Screen Rate publicly announces that 
it has ceased to provide that Screen Rate permanently or indefinitely and, at that 
time, there is no successor administrator to continue to provide that Screen Rate;
(ii)the date upon which the supervisor of the administrator of that Screen Rate 
publicly announces that such Screen Rate has been permanently or indefinitely 
discontinued; or
(iii)in the case of a Screen Rate for LIBOR, the date specified by the supervisor of the 
administrator of that Screen Rate in a public announcement or in published 
information as the date upon which that Screen Rate will no longer be 
representative of the underlying market or economic reality that it is intended to 
measure and that its representativeness will not be restored (as determined by such 
supervisor), where such announcement or publication is made with awareness that 
any such announcement or publication will engage certain triggers for fallback 
provisions in contracts which may be activated by any such pre-cessation 
announcement or publication.
(f) For the avoidance of doubt, the Trigger Date with respect to USD shall be 30 June 2023 (or 
if there is any delay to the cessation of the publication of US Dollar LIBOR for all available 
quoted tenors (as at the date of this Agreement) such later date).</p>

<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 333 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties AgreementSCHEDULE 11
Agreed Security Principles</p>
<ol>
<li>Agreed Security Principles</li>
</ol>
<p>(a) The guarantees and security to be provided under the Finance Documents will be given in 
accordance with the security principles set out in this Schedule 11 (the &quot;Agreed Security 
Principles&quot;). This Schedule 11 identifies the Agreed Security Principles and addresses the 
manner in which the Agreed Security Principles will impact on and determine the extent 
and terms of the guarantees and security proposed to be provided under any Finance 
Document.
(b) The Agreed Security Principles embody the recognition by all parties that there may be 
certain legal and practical difficulties in obtaining effective or commercially reasonable 
guarantees and/or security from all relevant members of the Group in each jurisdiction in 
which it has been agreed that guarantees and security will be granted by those members. In 
particular:
(i) general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, 
anti-trust and other competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent 
preference, equitable subordination, &quot;transfer pricing&quot;, &quot;thin capitalisation&quot;, 
&quot;earnings stripping&quot;, &quot;controlled foreign corporation&quot; and other tax restrictions, 
&quot;exchange control restrictions&quot;, &quot;capital maintenance&quot; rules and &quot;liquidity 
impairment&quot; rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation 
or approval requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of a member 
of the Group to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee 
or security be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the guarantee or security 
will be limited accordingly provided that, to the extent requested by the Security 
Agent before signing any applicable security or accession document, the relevant 
member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavours (but without incurring 
material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to 
overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document 
shall be subject to such limit;
(ii) key factors in determining whether or not (and the terms on which) a guarantee or 
security will be taken (and in respect of security, the extent of its perfection and/or 
registration) will be:
(A) the applicable time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes (including, 
in the Company's sole determination, in respect of the Group, its investors 
and/or its shareholders), interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration 
costs and taxes, notarial costs, translation costs and all applicable legal and 
notarial fees and adverse effects on the ability of the Group to obtain or 
maintain local facilities or other financing arrangements, including any 
factoring or similar arrangement in each case permitted under this 
Agreement) which will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to 
the Secured Parties of obtaining such guarantee or security, and the 
maximum guaranteed or secured amount may be limited to minimise 
stamp duty, notarisation, registration or other applicable fees, taxes and 
duties where the benefit of increasing the guaranteed or secured amount is 
disproportionate to the level of such fee, taxes and duties; and
(B) in respect of any guarantee or security which, in the determination of the 
Company (acting reasonably), may be required to be discharged and/or 
released in connection with any upcoming corporate, tax structuring or 
other reorganisation of the Group permitted by this Agreement or in 
respect of which the requisite percentage of Lenders have given their</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 334 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreementconsent (an &quot;Anticipated Reorganisation&quot;), the applicable time and cost 
(including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, 
registration taxes, notarial costs guarantee fees payable to any person that 
is not a member of the Group and all applicable legal fees) of taking, and 
then subsequently discharging and/or releasing such guarantee or security 
in connection with any Anticipated Reorganisation, will not be 
disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Secured Parties of obtaining 
such guarantee or security;
(iii) members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security 
documents if they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it 
is not within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would 
conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties of their Officers or contravene any 
applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction or have the 
potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any Officer 
of or for any member of the Group provided that, to the extent requested by the 
Security Agent before signing any applicable security document or accession 
document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavours (but 
without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with 
third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or 
security document shall be subject to such limit;
(iv) guarantees and security will be limited so that the aggregate of notarial costs and 
all registration and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will 
not exceed an amount to be agreed between the Company and the Security Agent;
(v) where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the 
cost of granting security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the 
benefit of such security, security will be granted over the material assets only;
(vi) it is expressly acknowledged that it may be either impossible or impractical to 
create security over certain categories of assets in which event security will not be 
taken over such assets;
(vii) any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, licence, instrument, 
regulatory constraint (including any agreement with any government or regulatory 
body) or other third party arrangement (other than restrictions contained in the 
constitutional documents of a member of the Group or in any intra-Group loan 
agreement), which may prevent or condition the asset from being charged, secured 
or being subject to the applicable security document (including requiring a consent 
of any third party, supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any 
asset which, if subject to the applicable security document, would give a third party 
the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations 
with respect to any member of the Group in respect of the asset or require the 
relevant chargor to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group 
or any member thereof, in each case will be excluded from a guarantee or security 
document;
(viii) the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the 
perfection of the security granted will not be required if it would have a material 
adverse effect on the ability of the relevant member of the Group to conduct its 
operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the 
Finance Documents (including dealing with the secured assets and all contractual 
counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any 
rights, benefits or obligations, in each case prior to a Declared Default or Declared 
RCF Default which is continuing), and any requirement under the Agreed Security</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 335 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties AgreementPrinciples to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall 
be subject to this sub-paragraph (viii);
(ix) any security document will only be required to be notarised if required by law in 
order for the relevant security to become effective or admissible in evidence;
(x) no guarantee or security will be required to be given by or over any Acquired 
Person or Asset (and no consent shall be required to be sought with respect thereto) 
which are required to support Acquired Indebtedness to the extent such Acquired 
Indebtedness is permitted by this Agreement to remain outstanding after an 
acquisition. No member of a target group or other entity acquired pursuant to an 
acquisition permitted by this Agreement shall be required to become a Guarantor 
or grant security with respect to the Facilities if prevented by the terms of the 
documentation governing that Acquired Indebtedness (including Acquired 
Indebtedness or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of such Acquired 
Indebtedness) or if becoming a Guarantor or the granting of any security would 
give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation) under or in relation 
thereto; no security will be granted over any asset secured for the benefit of any 
Permitted Indebtedness and/or to the extent constituting a Permitted Lien unless 
specifically required by a Finance Document to the contrary;
(xi) to the extent possible and unless required by applicable law, there should be no 
action required to be taken in relation to the guarantees or security when any lender 
assigns or transfers any of its participation to a New Lender (and, unless explicitly 
agreed to the contrary in this Agreement, no member of the Group shall bear or 
otherwise be liable for any taxes, any notarial, registration or perfection fees or any 
other costs, fees or expenses that result from any assignment or transfer by a 
Finance Party);
(xii) no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title 
insurance will be required;
(xiii) security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favour of a third 
party (other than in relation to security under general business conditions of 
account banks which do not prohibit or prevent the creation of Transaction 
Security over such accounts) or any cash constituting, or segregated as, regulatory 
capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded from any 
relevant security document);
(xiv) to the extent legally effective, all security will be given in favour of the Security 
Agent and not the secured creditors individually (with the Security Agent to hold 
one set of security documents for all the Finance Parties) &quot;parallel debt&quot; 
provisions will be used where necessary (and included in the Intercreditor 
Agreement and not the individual security documents);
(xv) no member of the Group will be required to take any action in relation to any 
guarantees or security as a result of any assignment or transfer by a Lender;
(xvi) guarantees and security will not be required from or over the assets of, any joint 
venture or similar arrangement, any minority interest or any member of the Group 
that is not wholly-owned by another member of the Group;
(xvii) each security document shall be deemed not to restrict or condition any transaction 
permitted under this Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement and the security 
granted under each security document shall be deemed to be subject to these 
Agreed Security Principles, before and after the execution of the relevant security 
document and creation of the relevant security;</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 336 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreement(xviii) no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or 
sharing provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement;
(xix) the Secured Parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at 
the relevant time) will not be able to exercise any power of attorney or set-off 
granted to them under the terms of the Finance Documents prior to the occurrence 
of a Declared Default or Declared RCF Default which is continuing;
(xx) no guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any &quot;Excluded Swap 
Obligations&quot; defined in accordance with the LSTA Market Advisory Update dated 
February 15, 2013 entitled &quot;Swap Regulations' Implications for Loan 
Documentation&quot;, and any update thereto by the LSTA;
(xxi) other than a general filing relating to a floating charge or blanket lien, no 
perfection, filing or other action will be required with respect to assets of a type 
not owned by members of the Group or not in a Guarantor Jurisdiction or otherwise 
over the shares of a member of the Group not located in a Guarantor Jurisdiction; 
(xxii) no translation of any document relating to any security or any asset subject to any 
security will be required to be prepared or provided to the Secured Parties, unless 
(i) required for such documents to become effective or admissible in evidence and 
(ii) a Declared Default or Declared RCF Default is continuing;
(xxiii) no security will be required over, or in connection with, any Escrowed Proceeds 
or other cash or securities held in escrow save in respect of Escrowed Proceeds, 
cash or securities held for the benefit of any Finance Party in its capacity as such 
and intended to form part of the Transaction Security; and 
(xxiv) no security shall be provided to the extent it would constitute or may constitute 
unlawful financial assistance or any equivalent provision of any applicable law.
(c) Notwithstanding any term of any Finance Document, no loan or other obligation of any US 
Obligor under any Finance Document may be, directly or indirectly:
(i) guaranteed by a CFC or by a FSHCO, or guaranteed by a Subsidiary of a CFC or 
FSHCO, in each case of such CFC, FSHCO or Subsidiary, that is owned by a 
member of the Group that is a &quot;United States Shareholder&quot; (as defined in Section 
951(b) of the Internal Revenue Code);
(ii) secured by any assets of a CFC, FSHCO or a Subsidiary of a CFC or a FSHCO 
(including any CFC or FSHCO equity interests held directly or indirectly by a CFC 
or FSHCO), in each case of such CFC, FSHCO or Subsidiary, that is owned by a 
member of the Group that is a &quot;United States Shareholder&quot; (as defined in Section 
951(b) of the Internal Revenue Code); 
(iii) secured by a pledge or other security interest in equity interests in a CFC or a 
FSHCO in excess of 65% of the total combined voting power of the voting equity 
interests and 100% of the non-voting equity interests of a first-tier CFC of a US 
Person or FSHCO, in each case of such CFC or FSHCO, that is owned by a 
member of the Group that is a &quot;United States Shareholder&quot; (as defined in Section 
951(b) of the Internal Revenue Code); or
(iv) guaranteed by any other Subsidiary or secured by a pledge of or security interest 
in any other Subsidiary or other asset, if it could, as determined by the Company 
(acting reasonably and in good faith), result in adverse US tax, accounting or 
regulatory consequences to any member of the Group or any of its direct or indirect 
owners (including the Investors).</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 337 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreement(d) For the purposes of the grant of security under the laws of the Province of Quebec which 
may now or in the future be required to be provided by any Obligor incorporated in Canada, 
the Security Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized and appointed to act as the hypothecary 
representative (within the meaning of Article 2692 of the Civil Code of Québec) for all 
Secured Parties in order to hold any hypothec granted under the laws of the Province of 
Quebec pursuant to a deed of hypothec as security for any obligations of any member of 
the Group under any of the Finance Documents and to exercise such rights and duties as 
are conferred upon a hypothecary representative under the relevant deed of hypothec and 
applicable laws (with the power to delegate any such rights or duties). The execution prior 
to the date hereof by the Security Agent of any deed of hypothec made pursuant to the laws 
of the Province of Quebec, is hereby ratified and confirmed. In the event of the resignation 
and appointment of a successor Security Agent such successor Security Agent shall also 
act as the successor hypothecary representative on behalf of all Secured Parties under each 
deed of hypothec without any further documentation or other formality being required to 
evidence the appointment of the successor hypothecary representative (subject to the 
registration of a notice of replacement as required by Article 2692 of the Civil Code of 
Québec). Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, this provision shall be 
governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Quebec.
2. Guarantees
Subject to the guarantee limitations set out in the Finance Documents, each guarantee will be an 
upstream, cross-stream and downstream guarantee for all liabilities of the Obligors under the 
Finance Documents in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of these Agreed Security 
Principles in each Relevant Jurisdiction (references to &quot;security&quot; to be read for this purpose as 
including guarantees). Security documents will secure the guarantee obligations of the relevant 
security provider or, if such security is provided on a third party basis, all liabilities of the Obligors 
under the Finance Documents, in each case in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of 
these Agreed Security Principles in each Relevant Jurisdiction.
3. Governing Law and Scope
(a) The guarantees and security to be provided in respect of the Facilities in accordance with 
the Agreed Security Principles are only to be given by Material Subsidiaries which are 
incorporated in the Guarantor Jurisdictions. No security or guarantees shall be required to 
be given by (or over the shares or investments in) (i) any entity not incorporated in a 
Guarantor Jurisdiction or (ii) any joint venture or similar arrangement, any minority interest 
or any member of the Group that is not wholly owned by another member of the Group.
(b) All security (other than share security) will be governed by the law of, and secure only 
assets located in, the jurisdiction of incorporation of the applicable grantor of the security 
and no action in relation to security (including any perfection step, further assurance step, 
filing or registration) will be required in jurisdictions where the grantor of the security is 
not incorporated. Share security over any subsidiary will be governed by the law of the 
place of incorporation of that subsidiary. Any security over a Structural Intercompany 
Receivable will be, at the option of the Company, governed by the governing law of such 
structural intra-group loan document or English law.
4. Terms of Security Documents
The following principles will be reflected in the terms of any security taken in connection with the 
Facilities:
(a) security will not be enforceable or crystallise until the occurrence of a Declared Default or 
Declared RCF Default which is continuing;</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 338 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreement(b) the beneficiaries of the security or any Agent will only be able to exercise a power of 
attorney following the occurrence of a Declared Default or Declared RCF Default which is 
continuing;
(c) the security documents should only operate to create security rather than to impose new 
commercial obligations or repeat clauses in other Finance Documents; accordingly:
(i) they should not contain additional representations, undertakings or indemnities 
(including in respect of insurance, information, maintenance or protection of 
assets, further assurance or the payment of fees, costs and expenses) unless 
required for the creation or perfection of security under applicable law; and
(ii) nothing in any security document shall (or be construed to) prohibit any 
transaction, matter or other step (or a grantor of security taking or entering into the 
same) or dealing in any manner whatsoever in relation to any asset (including all 
rights, claims, benefits, proceeds and documentation, and contractual 
counterparties in relation thereto) the subject of (or expressed to be the subject of) 
the security agreement if permitted by the terms of the other Finance Documents 
(and accordingly to such extent, the Security Agent shall promptly effect releases, 
confirmations, consents to deal or similar steps always at the cost of the relevant 
grantor of the security);
(d) no security will be granted over parts, stock, moveable plant, equipment or receivables if it 
would require labelling, segregation or periodic listing or specification of such parts, stock, 
moveable plant, equipment or receivables;
(e) perfection will not be required in respect of (i) vehicles and other assets subject to 
certificates of title or (ii) letter of credit rights and tort claims (or the local law equivalent);
(f) in no event shall control agreements (or perfection by control or similar arrangements) be 
required with respect to any assets (including deposit or securities accounts);
(g) security will, where possible and practical, automatically create security over future assets 
of the same type as those already secured; where local law requires supplemental pledges, 
lists of assets or notices to be delivered in respect of future acquired assets in order for 
effective security to be created over that class of asset, such supplemental pledges, lists of 
assets or notices will be provided only upon request of the Security Agent and at intervals 
no more frequent than annually;
(h) each security document must contain a clause which records that if there is a conflict 
between the security document and this Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement then (to 
the fullest extent permitted by law) the provisions of this Agreement or (as applicable) the 
Intercreditor Agreement will take priority over the provisions of the security document (and 
that, if requested to do so by (and at the cost of) the Company, the Security Agent will enter 
into such amendments, waivers or consents as are necessary to remove such conflict); and
(i) each security document must contain a clause substantially similar to the following:
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement but without prejudice to the 
creation or perfection of any security interest under this Agreement, the terms of this 
Agreement shall not operate or be construed so as to prohibit or restrict any transaction, 
matter or other step (or the [security grantor] taking or entering into the same or dealing 
in any manner whatsoever in relation to any asset (including all rights, claims, benefits, 
proceeds and documentation, and contractual counterparties in relation thereto)) 
permitted by the [Debt Documents] (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (other than 
this Agreement), and the Security Agent shall promptly enter into such documentation 
and/or take such other action in relation to this Agreement as is required by the [security</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 339 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreementgrantor] (acting reasonably) in order to facilitate any such transaction, matter or other 
step, including by way of executing any confirmation, consent to dealing, release or other 
similar or equivalent document, or returning any physical collateral; and
(j) the closure, unavailability, or reduced service of any governmental or regulatory systems, 
any functions or any facilities (including notarial or legal facilities) necessary or 
customarily used for the granting of security or guarantees, or the taking of any perfection 
requirements in connection therewith, may affect and/or delay the ability of a member of 
the Group to provide a guarantee or security or take any related steps in connection with 
any perfection requirements.
5. Bank Accounts
(a) If an Obligor grants security over its material current bank accounts it will be free to deal, 
operate and transact business in relation to those accounts (including opening and closing 
accounts) until the occurrence of a Declared Default or Declared RCF Default which is 
continuing. For the avoidance of doubt, there will be no &quot;fixed&quot; security over bank 
accounts, cash or receivables or any obligation to hold or pay cash or receivables in a 
particular account until the occurrence of a Declared Default or Declared RCF Default 
which is continuing. 
(b) Subject to paragraph (c), no notice of security may be prepared or served on and consent to 
the security requested from, the account bank until the occurrence of a Declared Default or 
Declared RCF Default which is continuing.
(c) If an Obligor grants security over its material current bank accounts (and (x) the giving of 
notice of security is market practice in the Relevant Jurisdiction and (y) it is possible to 
give such notice of security without disrupting the operation of the account(s) in question, 
in each case as determined by the Company in its sole discretion), notice of the security 
will be served on the account bank in relation to applicable accounts within ten (10) 
Business Days from (and excluding) the date of the security document (or accession 
thereto) and the applicable grantor of the security will use its reasonable endeavours to 
obtain an acknowledgement of that notice within twenty (20) Business Days of service. If 
the grantor of the security has used its reasonable endeavours but has not been able to obtain 
acknowledgement or acceptance its obligation to obtain acknowledgement will cease on 
the expiry of that twenty (20) Business Day period. Irrespective of whether notice of the 
security is required for perfection, if the service of notice would prevent any member of the 
Group from using a bank account in the course of its business no notice of security will be 
served until the occurrence of a Declared Default or Declared RCF Default which is 
continuing.
(d) Any security over bank accounts will be subject to any security interests in favour of the 
account bank which are created either by law or in the standard terms and conditions of the 
account bank. No member of the Group will be required to change its banking arrangements 
or standard terms and conditions in connection with the granting of bank account security.
(e) If required under applicable local law, security over bank accounts will be registered subject 
to the general principles set out in these Agreed Security Principles following the 
occurrence of a Declared Default or Declared RCF Default which is continuing.
(f) No security will be required to be granted over any account:
(i) in which securities or other non-cash assets are or become held or are to be held;
(ii) which is or becomes subject to any cash pooling arrangement;</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 340 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreement(iii) which is designated at any time or to be designated as a collections, restricted or 
similar account in respect of any factoring or receivables financing arrangement;
(iv) which is designated at any time as a cash collateral or similar account in respect of 
any indebtedness; or
(v) over which a Permitted Lien is or is required to be granted in connection with any 
Permitted Indebtedness (other than Permitted Indebtedness under the Secured Debt 
Documents) as a condition of such Permitted Indebtedness being made available,
and if such security has been granted, such security will be promptly released if such 
account later falls within any of the exceptions described in paragraphs (i) to (v) above.
6. Fixed assets
Without prejudice to the Overriding Principle, if an Obligor grants security over its material fixed 
assets it will be free to deal with those assets in the course of its business until the occurrence of a 
Declared Default or Declared RCF Default which is continuing. No notice, whether to third parties 
or by attaching a notice to the fixed assets, will be prepared or given until the occurrence of a 
Declared Default or Declared RCF Default which is continuing. No list of fixed assets shall be 
required.
7. Insurance policies
(a) If an Obligor grants security over its material insurance policies (excluding any third party 
liability or public liability insurance and any directors and officers insurance in respect of 
which claims thereunder may be mandatorily prepaid, provided that the relevant insurance 
policy allows security to be so granted), notice of any security interest over insurance 
policies will only be served on an insurer of the Group assets upon written request of the 
Security Agent, which may only be given after the occurrence of a Declared Default or 
Declared RCF Default which is continuing.
(b) Prior to a Declared Default or Declared RCF Default which is continuing, no loss payee or 
other endorsement will be made on the insurance policy, no insurance certificates shall be 
required to be delivered to any Secured Party and no Secured Party will be named as co-
insured.
8. Intellectual property
(a) No security will be granted over any intellectual property which cannot be secured under 
the terms of the relevant licensing agreement.
(b) Without prejudice to the Overriding Principle, if security is granted over the relevant 
material intellectual property, the grantor shall be free to deal with, use, licence and 
otherwise commercialise those assets in the course of its business (including allowing its 
intellectual property to lapse if no longer material to its business) until a Declared Default 
or Declared RCF Default which is continuing.
(c) Notice of any security interest over intellectual property will only be served on a third party 
from whom intellectual property is licensed upon written request of the Security Agent, 
which may only be given after the occurrence of a Declared Default or Declared RCF 
Default which is continuing. No intellectual property security will be required to be 
registered under the law of that security document, the law where the grantor is regulated, 
or at any relevant supra-national registry. Security over intellectual property rights will be 
taken on an &quot;as is, where is&quot; basis and the Group will not be required to procure any changes 
to, or corrections of filings on, external registers.</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 341 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreement9. Receivables
Without prejudice to the Overriding Principle, if an Obligor grants security over any of its 
receivables it will be free to deal with, amend, waive or terminate those receivables in the course of 
its business until the occurrence of a Declared Default or Declared RCF Default which is continuing. 
No notice of security may be prepared or served until the occurrence of a Declared Default or 
Declared RCF Default which is continuing (other than security over the Structural Intercompany 
Receivables). No list of receivables shall be required. If required under local law, security over 
receivables will be registered subject to the general principles set out in these Agreed Security 
Principles following the occurrence of a Declared Default or Declared RCF Default which is 
continuing.
10. Real estate
No security will be granted over real property.
11. Shares
(a) Security over shares, stocks or partnership interests granted by an Obligor will be limited 
to those over a wholly-owned Obligor incorporated in a Guarantor Jurisdiction. For the 
avoidance of doubt, no security shall be required to be granted by, or over the shares in, 
entities which are not wholly-owned Obligors incorporated in a Guarantor Jurisdiction.
(b) Until a Declared Default or Declared RCF Default is continuing, the legal title of the shares 
will remain with the relevant grantor of the security (unless transfer of title on granting such 
security is customary in the applicable jurisdiction (as agreed between the legal counsel of 
the Group and the legal counsel of the Agent in the Relevant Jurisdiction)) and any grantor 
of share security will be permitted to retain and to exercise voting rights and powers in 
relation to any shares and other related rights charged by it and receive, own and retain all 
assets and proceeds in relation thereto without restriction or condition. 
(c) With respect to the shares in any member of the Group that have been pledged pursuant to 
a Transaction Security Document, where customary and applicable as a matter of law, the 
applicable share certificate (or other documents evidencing title to the relevant shares) and 
a stock transfer form executed in blank (or applicable law equivalent) will be provided to 
the Security Agent:
(i) (with respect to any Transaction Security Document entered into pursuant to Part 
I of Schedule 2 ( Conditions Precedent)), as soon as reasonably practicable 
following the Initial Utilisation Date (and taking into account any stamping 
requirements in respect of any stock transfer form (or applicable law equivalent)); 
and
(ii) (with respect to any other Transaction Security Document), as soon as reasonably 
practicable following execution (and taking into account any stamping 
requirements in respect of any stock transfer form (or applicable law equivalent)) 
of that Transaction Security Document.
12. The Overriding Principle

the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional 
shares or Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or 
obligations not previously treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will not be 
deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under 
this Section 1; provided that the amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of 
any outstanding Indebtedness may (in the Company's sole discretion) be increased by the 
amount of all such accrued and/or capitalised interest, accreted value, original issue

under this Section 1 the Company shall not be permitted to designate such Unrestricted 
Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary and any such designation will not be deemed effective

principal amount of Indebtedness (or liquidation preference in the case of Disqualified

in Clause 26.3 ( Calculations) (whichever yields the lower currency equivalent); provided 
that if such determination is made with respect to Indebtedness which is Incurred to 
refinance other Indebtedness denominated in another currency, and such refinancing would 
cause the applicable currency denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the 
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such currency 
denominated restriction, as applicable, shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long 
as the principal amount (or liquidation preference in the case of Disqualified Stock or 
Preferred Stock) of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount 
(or liquidation preference in the case of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock) set forth in 
sub-clause (c) of the definition of &quot;Refinancing Indebtedness&quot;.
(g) For the avoidance of doubt, Indebtedness (excluding any Guarantee thereof) incurred

applicable conditions set out in Clause 2.2 (Additional Facilities) of this Agreement.

profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the &quot;Initial Lien&quot;), 
except:
(i) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Charged Property:
(A) Permitted Liens; or
(B) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if obligations

Indebtedness is so secured; and

Indebtedness at the time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be 
permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness. The &quot;Increased Amount&quot; 
of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such Indebtedness in 
connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortisation of 
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with 
the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases 
in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange 
rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

agreeing to such Asset Disposition and without giving effect to subsequent 
changes in value), as determined in good faith by the Company, of the shares and 
assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if 
such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);
(ii) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions, with a

a cumulative basis), received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as 
the case may be, is in the form of Cash Equivalent Investments provided that the 
amount of:
(A) the greater of the principal amount and the carrying value of any liabilities 
(as reflected on the Company's or such Restricted Subsidiary's most recent 
consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto or, if Incurred or 
increased subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that 
would have been reflected on the Company's or such Restricted 
Subsidiary's consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such 
incurrence or increase had taken place on or prior to the date of such 
balance sheet, as determined by the Company) of the Company or such 
Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms 
subordinated to the Facilities, that are (1) assumed by the transferee of any

Restricted Subsidiary from such liabilities or (2) otherwise cancelled or 
terminated in connection with the transaction; 
(B) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the 
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are

Equivalent Investments (to the extent of the Cash Equivalent Investments 
received or expected to be received) or by their terms are required to be 
satisfied for Cash Equivalent Investments within one hundred and eighty 
(180) days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; 
(C) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted 
Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the

Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset 
Disposition;

Guarantor (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the 
Acquisition Closing Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any

Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Disposition having an aggregate fair 
market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash

amount equal to twenty five (25) per cent. of LTM EBITDA at the time of 
the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration (or, at the 
Company's option, at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset 
Disposition), with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-
cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without 
giving effect to subsequent changes in value,
shall each be deemed to be Cash Equivalent Investments for purposes of this 
provision and for no other purpose; and
(iii) an amount equal to one hundred (100) per cent. of the Net Available Cash from 
such Asset Disposition is applied, to the extent the Company or any Restricted 
Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (at its sole discretion):
(A) to prepay, redeem, repay, purchase or (in the case of letters of credit, 
bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments constituting 
Indebtedness) cash collateralize:
(1) any Senior Secured Indebtedness; and/or
(2) any other Permitted Debt (provided that such application would 
comply with Section 2 (Limitation on Restricted Payments)),
(in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any 
Restricted Subsidiary); 
(B) to invest in or commit to invest in Additional Assets (including by means 
of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary equal to 
the amount of Net Available Cash received by the Company or another

of (1) the date of such Asset Disposition and (2) the receipt of such Net 
Available Cash, provided that:

purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to sub-paragraph (A) above, 
the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such 
Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) 
(other than in the case of any asset-based credit facility or any 
revolving credit facility (including a Revolving Facility)) to be 
reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, 
redeemed, repaid or purchased  (except that no such reduction 
will be required to the extent that such Indebtedness would, 
immediately after giving effect to such prepayment, redemption, 
repayment or repurchase, have been capable of being reincurred 
under Section 1 (Limitation on Indebtedness));
(2) a binding commitment or letter of intent entered into not later 
than such five hundred and forty-fifth (545th) day shall be treated</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 385 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreementas a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date 
of such commitment or letter of intent so long as the Company, 
or such Restricted Subsidiary, enters into such commitment or 
letter of intent with the good faith expectation that such Net 
Available Cash will be applied to satisfy such commitment or 
letter of intent within the later of such five hundred and forty- 
fifth (545th) day and one hundred and eighty (180) days of such 
commitment or letter of intent (an &quot;Acceptable Commitment&quot;) 
or, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or 
terminated for any reason before the Net Available Cash is 
applied in connection therewith, the Company or such Restricted 
Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a 
&quot;Second Commitment&quot;) within one hundred and eighty (180) 
days of such cancellation or termination; provided further that 
if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for 
any reason before such Net Available Cash is applied, then such 
Net Available Cash shall constitute Excess Proceeds; and
(3) pending the final application of the amount of any such Net 
Available Cash in accordance with sub-paragraphs (A) to (C) 
above or otherwise in accordance with this Section 4, the 
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily 
reduce Indebtedness or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in 
any manner not prohibited by this Agreement.
(b) The following amount of Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or 
invested or committed to be applied or invested as provided in paragraph (a) above will be 
deemed to constitute &quot;Excess Proceeds&quot; under this Agreement:
(i) if the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date in respect 
of the relevant Asset Disposition exceeds 6.30:1.00 on a pro forma basis, one 
hundred (100) per cent of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition; or 
(ii) if the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date in respect 
of the relevant Asset Disposition exceeds 6.05:1.00 but does not exceed 6.30:1.00 
on a pro forma basis, fifty (50) per cent. of the Net Available Cash from such Asset 
Disposition; or 
(iii) if the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date in respect 
of the relevant Asset Disposition does not exceed 6.05:1.00 on a pro forma basis, 
zero (0) per cent. of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition,
provided that:
(A) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to 
prepay, repay or purchase any amount of Senior Secured Indebtedness 
(other than Obligations under this Agreement) at a price of no less than 
one hundred (100) per cent. of the principal amount thereof, and has 
extended such offer to the Lenders on at least a pro rata basis pursuant to 
Clause 12.3 ( Application of prepayments), to the extent the creditors in 
respect of such Senior Secured Indebtedness (including the Lenders) elect 
not to tender their Senior Secured Indebtedness for such prepayment, 
repayment or purchase, the Company will be deemed to have applied an 
amount of Net Available Cash equal to such amount not tendered under 
this paragraph (A), and such amount shall not increase the amount of 
Excess Proceeds (such amount, together with the aggregate amount 
described under paragraph (d) below, the &quot;Declined Proceeds&quot;); and</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 386 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreement(B) for the avoidance of doubt, Net Available Cash that will not constitute 
Excess Proceeds pursuant to paragraph (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph (b) 
shall be immediately available to the Group for any purposes permitted by 
this Agreement, including to make Restricted Payments in accordance 
with Section 2 (Limitation on Restricted Payments), without regard to the 
periods specified in paragraphs (a)(iii)(A) to (a)(iii)(C) above.
(c) On the 546th day (or such longer period permitted by paragraph (a) above) after the later 
of an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount 
of Excess Proceeds under this Agreement exceeds the greater of (x) £62 million and (y) an 
amount equal to thirty (30) per cent. of LTM EBITDA in a single transaction, the Company 
will within ten (10) Business Days make an offer (an &quot;Asset Disposition Offer&quot;) to each 
Lender under each Term Facility, and if required or permitted by the terms of any Senior 
Secured Indebtedness, to the holders of such Senior Secured Indebtedness, to prepay 
outstanding Term Facilities (and only to the extent any Term Facilities are outstanding) 
held by any such Lender at par, and to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount 
(or accreted value, as applicable) of any such Senior Secured Indebtedness that may be 
purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to the 
offer price required by the terms thereof, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the 
agreement(s) governing such Senior Secured Indebtedness.
(d) The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash 
from an Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to such Net 
Available Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant five hundred and forty-five (545) days 
(or such longer period provided above) with respect to all or part of the Net Available Cash 
(the &quot;Advance Portion&quot;) in advance of being required to do so by this Agreement (an 
&quot;Advance Offer&quot;).
(e) Clauses 12.3 ( Application of prepayments) and 12.4 ( Invitation to Refuse Prepayment) shall 
apply to any prepayment of the Term Facilities (or, in the case of paragraph (c) of Clause 
12.3 ( Application of prepayments), any distribution by any Subsidiary to the Company or 
another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this Section 4)) 
contemplated by paragraph (c) above.
(f) If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Term Facilities 
elected to be repaid or other Senior Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, surrendered 
by such holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in the Asset Disposition Offer (or in 
the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company shall repay the Term 
Facilities and such Senior Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis 
based on the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Term 
Facilities offered to be repaid or such Senior Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, 
tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Term Facilities to be repaid or Senior 
Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized 
denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Disposition Offer (or Advance Offer), 
the amount of Excess Proceeds that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset 
Disposition Offer shall be reset to zero (0) (regardless of whether there are any remaining 
Excess Proceeds upon such completion). Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset 
Disposition Offer, any remaining Net Available Cash shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds 
and the Company may use such Net Available Cash for any purpose permitted by this 
Agreement.
(g) To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of outstanding 
Term Facilities prepaid and Senior Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered 
pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the amount offered in the Asset 
Disposition Offer (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company 
may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance 
Portion) for any purposes not otherwise prohibited under this Agreement.</p>
<p>KE 39675-89:114878275.43 387 Project Neptune - Senior Facilties Agreement(h) Pending the final application of the amount of any Net Available Cash pursuant to this 
Section 4, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce 
Indebtedness, or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner permitted by this 
Agreement.
5. Limitation on Affiliate Transactions
(a) The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into or 
conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease 
or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the 
Company (any such transaction or series of related transactions being an &quot;Affiliate 
Transaction&quot;) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of (x) £20.75 million and 
(y) an amount equal to ten (10) per cent. of LTM EBITDA unless:
(i) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less 
favorable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than 
those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction at the time of such 
transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in 
arm's length dealings with a person who is not such an Affiliate; and
(ii) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the 
greater of (x) £31 million and (y) an amount equal to fifteen (15) per cent. of LTM 
EBITDA, the terms of such Affiliate Transaction have been approved by a 
majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company, provided that 
any Affiliate Transaction shall also be deemed to have satisfied the requirements 
set forth in this paragraph (a)(ii) if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a 
majority of the Disinterested Directors of the Company, if any. 
(b) The provisions of paragraph (a) above will not apply to:
(i) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described 
under Section 2 (Limitation on Restricted Payments) or any Permitted Investment;
(ii) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or 
other securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or

of the reference period but prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of the

then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence, 
deemed Incurrence, assumption, Guarantee, redemption, defeasance, retirement, extinguishment or 
other discharge of Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of Disqualified Stock or Preferred

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, any Purchase or Sale that has been made 
by the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries, during the reference period or subsequent to 
the reference period shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that such Purchase or Sale 
(and the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in LTM EBITDA 
resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the reference period.
If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest 
on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio 
Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire reference period (taking into account 
any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalized Lease 
Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by an Officer of the 
Company to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with 
IFRS. For purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under 
a revolving credit facility computed with a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the 
average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the reference period except as set forth in the 
first paragraph of this definition. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an 
interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or 
other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then 
based upon such optional rate chosen as the Company may designate.
For the purposes of this definition, &quot;Consolidated Interest Expense&quot; will be calculated using an 
assumed interest rate based on the indicative interest margin contained in any financing commitment 
documentation with respect to such Indebtedness or, if no such indicative interest margin exists, as 
reasonably determined by the Company in good faith.
&quot;Fixed Charges&quot; means, with respect to any person for any period, the sum of:
